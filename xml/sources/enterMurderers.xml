				<head type="chapter">FOREWARD IN DEFENSE OF CAIN</head>
				<p>IF ALL THE WORLD loves a lover-and there have been those who have cast doubt upon the statement—so does all the world love a murderer too, though perhaps after a somewhat different fashion.</p>
				<p>The name of Cain has passed into the language as the hallmark of his kind, yet one suspects that were each of us to be quite honest in the matter, we would be obliged to confess to a sneaking sympathy for that early transgressor who disposed so efficiently of the first &quot;mama's boy&quot; in history.</p>
				<p>Moreover, we are indebted to Cain, rather than to Abel, certainly, for the continuation of the race; and we are scarcely in a position to complain if we have taken after our great progenitor. Too, Cain was the first rebel on earth, as Satan was the first in heaven, and there is enough of the rebel still in most of us to feel the call of the blood.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, there are murderers far less likable than Cain, and victims who arouse our pity to a far greater extent than Abel. Both kinds will be found in this book.</p>
				<p>For here are a handful of murders, all bloody, all dra-matic, and all American. (I do not propose them for an All American murder team, although we are as patriotic in our thirst for blood as we are in everything else.)</p>
				<p>The popularity of stories of crime is not far to seek, and is as ancient as evil, for from time immemorial God and the Devil have wrestled for first place in the news.</p>
				<p>The natural tendency of civilized behavior being towards normality or that indefinable condition known as &quot;good-ness,&quot; whatever deviates from the normal and good becomes strange, startling, and, therefore, interesting.</p>
				<p>And this quite aside from the innumerable social and ethical concepts that vary with each generation and with every degree of latitude. Crime is rebellion against the established order; rebellion entails conflict; conflict, action, and so drama is born. Stories of crime are dramatic stories perforce, in their very nature, and whether they deal with fact or fiction.</p>
				<p>At Temple Stairs, one day in 1776, the great Dr. Johnson remarked to Boswell, &quot;The value of every story depends upon its being true; a story is a picture either of an individual or of human nature.&quot; As a historian of crime, as a writer of criminal fiction, and as a reader of both, I am much inclined to agree with this. Certainly, the actual criminal cases in my own library outnumber the fictional cases more than a hundred to one. One could come close to reconstructing the history of England from the two series of State Trials and Notable British Trials alone, and while the result might be sordid, it would certainly be well Havored, dramatic, and authentic. JACK SHEPPARD was as typical of his period as HARRY THAW was of his; and while the pictures one gets through them of eighteenth-century London and twentieth-century New York may not be inclusive, they are, at least, highly significant of their life and times.</p>
				<p>If this is true, and I do not think it can be successfully disputed, it is certainly equally true that the penetrating and lurid light cast by a crime upon those persons who have actual parts to play in the drama of its commission is no less illuminating. Granting Pope's dictum that &quot;the proper study of mankind is man,&quot; the study of crime gives us an unparalleled opportunity for observing man in all his unattractive nakedness.</p>
				<p>After all is said and done, however, and after we have rationalized our predilections to our hearts' content, what we want most of all is simply a good story. Perhaps, if murder fulfills no more useful purpose, it may be condoned as supplying that need on the part of mankind.</p>
				<p>On the desk near me lies an old pamphlet, dated 1642, several years before good King Charles lost his head, metaphorically and literally. This somewhat tattered criminological item tells of the shocking crimes of Lord Audley—Lady Audley's Secret was indeed a ghastly one! —and of the trial of the noble gentleman, in which the embarrassed peer begins by saying, &quot;I am of a weak speech at the best,&quot; and ends with, &quot;I desire to be pardoned in those things of which I must accuse myself, but I wish not that condemnation should come out of my own mouth.&quot;</p>
				<p>Reader, so say I!</p>

				<head type="chapter">THE SHIP THAT NEVER RETURNED</head>
				<p>The ship was short-handed. Yankee ships were apt to be short-handed in those days, but his mate, Mr. Jenkins, certainly got the last ounce out of the crew.</p>
				<p>The Fairy was a new vessel, out of the Boston yard, where she was built only a year, and of only eighty-two tons. Her owners, Cunningham Brothers, had spared nothing to make her the tight little ship, well built and well found, that she was. Seven thousand dollars she was valued at, and that was a small fortune in 1826. Not only was the Fairy a ship to be proud of, but she was Selfridge's first command, and Selfridge was only twenty-three years old. The captain squared his shoulders, spun sharply in his short walk along the deck, and strode the other way.</p>
				<p>Edward Selfridge had been at sea ever since he was a small boy and had sailed many a voyage out of Boston to the East Indies and to Europe under the command of that famous skipper, Thomas B. Curtis. Indeed, it was on Cur-tis' warm recommendation to the owners of the Fairy that Selfridge had been given command of their new vessel on her second voyage. He was a smart, intelligent young officer, Curtis had said, sober and reliable, as fine a lad as had ever sailed under him; mild mannered enough, but able to manage his men with a firm hand. They'd be fortunate to get him. The Cunninghams thought so too.</p>
				<p>The Fairy had left Boston a week before, on the 2oth of August, bound for Gottenburg with a mixed cargo: a hold full of coffee and fustic, rice, sugar, and tobacco. They had anchored overnight in Nantasket Roads and put to sea again early the next morning. All week they had had warm, pleasant weather, perhaps with too little wind to suit a Yankee skipper, although the Fairy had shown that she could step along in light airs as well as in a breeze. Doubtless it was just as well they hadn't run into any real weather, with only three hands to hoist and shorten sail on an eighty-two-ton ship. Now they were close to the Grand Bank. Captain Selfridge noted approvingly the streak of white which the Fairy's bow flung back from the long, green seas. With any kind of a favoring wind, he thought to himself, they'd be well out in the Atlantic by this time tomorrow.</p>
				<p>While the brothers Cunningham had spared neither pains nor money in building a good ship, they had, on this voyage at any rate, scamped their duties in a curiously precarious fashion. In fact, this lapse, if so it can be called, on their part has never been explained to this day except by saying that they found it necessary to save money. If this explanation be the true one, the shipowners evidently did not realize the truth in the ancient adage that a good ship can be spoiled for a pennyworth of tar. In brief, what the Cunninghams had done was to send an eighty-foot schooner to sea with only three hands before the mast. Three hands and a cook! A fishing vessel of the size of the Fairy would carry, today, at least twenty-one hands, and while the Fairy could have done well enough with less than twenty-one to work the ship, the fact that there were only three meant that there would be little rest for any of the crew even in fair weather, while in a blow it is difficult to see how they could have managed sail at all. What did the Cunningham Brothers have in mind in sending so staunch a craft on a long voyage so woefully under-manned? And how did they get men to ship in her, and a captain ike Selfridge to take command? The records are silent. The questions were all raised, but when they were raised the men who might have answered them fled as from the plague.</p>
				<p>The roster of this strange crew is of importance.</p>
				<p>Captain Selfridge we already know.</p>
				<p>Mate Jenkins, Joseph Paine Jenkins in full, was a Massachusetts man, twenty-five years old, &quot;of .good size, stout and active.&quot; Ordinarily calm enough, he had a quick temper that spat like a tongue of flame on any provoca-tion, but the Cunninghams had found him a capable officer, and he had been in the Fairy since she was built. Evidently a pretty typical Yankee mate of his day and age, quick with his fists and handy with his tongue, but a good seaman.</p>
				<p>Charles Marchant was a British seaman of Welsh ex-traction; a &quot;limey,&quot; in the vernacular of the American sailor. (This because of the habit on many British ships of serving out a ration of limejuice to the crew in order to ward off the dreaded scurvy.)</p>
				<p>John Hughes was just such another as Marchant.</p>
				<p>Winslow Curtis was a Yankee, like the skipper, the mate, and the cook.</p>
				<p>None of these three had sailed with the ship, with either officer, or even with each other, before.</p>
				<p>The last member of the crew was the cook, a lad of nineteen named Murray. He too was from Boston, and had made a voyage with Mate Jenkins before.</p>
				<p>As in all sailing ships, the crew were divided into watches, usually called the larboard, or port, and the starboard watch. Marchant stood watch with the mate; Curtis and Hughes with the captain. Murray, as cook, was not required to stand any watch at all. The captain and mate berthed in the cabin, aft; the crew bunked forward in the fo'c'sle.</p>
				<p>Captain Selfridge paused in his Sunday morning walk, frowned, spoke sharply to the man at the wheel.</p>
				<p>&quot;What's your course, Curtis?&quot;</p>
				<p>He rapped it out, reproof rather than inquiry in his tone. Curtis was nodding at the wheel again.</p>
				<p>Curtis came to with a jerk, shot a telltale glance at the binnacle, and mumbled his reply. He gave the captain's back an ugly look as Selfridge resumed his pacing.</p>
				<p>The only cloud in the otherwise clear sky of the voyage, so far as Captain Selfridge was concerned, was represented by the dubious pair, Curtis and Marchant. Jenkins, the mate, had recruited them both just before the ship sailed. They had been loading the Fairy in exceptionally hot weather, and Jenkins, by methods best known to first mates of that period, had produced Curtis from a sailors' lodging house and Marchant from some other waterfront dive. Marchant, the captain had seen from the outset, was nothing but a lazy, good-for-nothing limey, but he had been put in the mate's watch, and Jenkins was keeping a firm hand on him. Curtis, however, was a Yankee, a Massachusetts man like the captain himself, and only on the second night out Curtis had gone to sleep at the wheel.</p>
				<p>The captain had been below when he suddenly noticed the altered pitch of the vessel and heard the lazy flap of the sails as the schooner came up into the wind. In two jumps he gained the deck, flung a bucket over the side and hauled it in, all in one swift motion, and flung the contents over the sleeping man. Curtis leaped to his feet as a drowning rat might leap from a drain. The waters of the North Atlantic are cold even in August, and this was the time-honored treatment for sailors asleep at the wheel.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, Curtis nursed a grudge.</p>
				<p>At the helm now, Curtis peered through the cabin skylight at the cabin clock and saw that it was a half minute to eight. As he marked the time on the ship's bell, Hughes, his watch mate, went forward to the fo'c'sle hatch and called to the watch below to take over the ship. Marchant -the only man in that watch!-came up and took the wheel from Curtis. The captain and his watch went below, and the mate, Jenkins, came on deck.</p>
				<p>If anyone could get the Fairy across the Atlantic with only three hands before the mast, Joseph Paine Jenkins was the man. Either they would take that vessel into Gottenburg and back again to Boston or Mate Jenkins would know the reason why! So far, mused the mate, everything had gone well enough; not exactly smoothly, for the men were complaining, but well enough. True, there was that small ax that had been missing from the cabin bulkhead for several days. The mate had had Murray, the cook, search for it, but to no purpose. That was disturbing, if you liked. Things don't get lost aboard ship, where there is a place for everything and lives may depend on having everything in its place. And, of course, there was a lot of murmuring in the fo'c'sle, but there was bound to be when they were so short handed and, any-how, sailors wouldn't be sailors if they didn't complain.</p>
				<p>There had been one real outburst, and that from Mar-chant, on the dock the day that they had sailed. Marchant had been loafing on the job, complaining of the heat, when Jenkins, with an oath, had ordered:</p>
				<p>&quot;Here, damn you, bear a hand and get this wood in!&quot; </p>
				<p>And Marchant had cursed back with:</p>
				<p>&quot;Who the hell are you ordering? Do you think you've got a gang of bloody niggers under you?&quot; The mate had silenced him effectually, for Mr. Jenkins had met and dealt with Marchant's kind before. And then, after sailing, Marchant had complained on finding that he had to stand the four hours of his watch at the wheel, instead of only two. But there was no one to relieve him. In the captain's watch there were two men, each of whom did a trick at the helm. Marchant stood the mate's whole watch alone.</p>
				<p>Under the circumstances, it would not have been unreasonable for the mate to take a turn at the wheel, but Jenkins didn't see it that way. Either that wasn't his idea of discipline, or he had made up his mind that Marchant needed a bit of hazing. Marchant seems to have had some reason for his point of view, voiced on the dock before sailing. It was the contemporary point of view of the British sailor in those days, who regarded a Yankee ship with an aversion second only to his abhorrence of a Blue-nose, a Nova Scotiaman. No decks were as snowy, no canvas broken out an smartly, no sail carried as long, and, consequently, no crew driven as hard as in these ships, Yankee and Bluenose; especially in the latter, where the skipper was usually builder and owner as well. And so, to Marchant, the Fairy was &quot;one of those damned, nigger-driving Yankees where they work the soul-case out of the hands and let you rest when you're dead.&quot; </p>
				<p>Though they were in different watches, Marchant and Curtis found a minute here and there to exchange their views, and on this fine Sunday morning Marchant found Curtis in a mood that matched his own. Curtis was still smarting from the captain's reproof.</p>
				<p>&quot;The damned rascal,&quot; said he, &quot;had better not throw another bucket of water on me!&quot;</p>
				<p>As they exchanged the wheel, the two talked for a moment in low tones.</p>
				<p>The stout little ship Fairy, out of Boston for Gotten-burg, sailed on through the summer seas.</p>
				<p>Midday brought intense heat, and an aching glare from the white decks and the stiff new sails. A streak of smoke came from the galley chimney, and the hot, pungent reek of frying pork blew back along the deck. The men were tired, and the heat only added to their weariness and increased their irritability. At intervals, Murray's flushed face emerged from the galley hatch as he sought a breath of air.</p>
				<p>Below, in the neat new cabin, Captain Selfridge lay in his bunk, staring at the blue patch of sky that blazed down at him through the open skylight, his mind busy with the plans this new command was going to make possible. His mother wouldn't need all his earnings now— there were two other boys in the family—and on a captain's pay he and Mary could marry, could buy a little house.. with green shutters and frilled white curtains, and red geraniums on the window sills. There would be whitewashed stones around the flower beds too, and he would bring home some conch shells to put at the front door; and Mary would have a workbox, all over shells, to put on the parlor table. The young captain's eyes closed in the drowsy heat.</p>
				<p>Overhead, Mate Jenkins' firm tread paced the deck. Presently it ceased. The day was stifling, even with the light breeze. The long, smooth swells gave back the blinding sunlight, pouring down from a cloudless August sky. Jenkins looked off to the west. Somewhere off there, in Nova Scotia, Jenkins' sister lived. It would be nice up there now, in summer, in Cape Breton Island, up around Louisbourg, where the French used to have that fort. He wished that he was there...</p>
				<p>At the wheel, Marchant, his ugly face blistering in the sun, kept the schooner headed east by north.</p>
				<p>Nothing that we know or ever shall know of the events of that August Sunday aboard the Fairy conveys any hint that either the captain or the mate dreamed that the sullen man at the wheel was busy plotting mutiny and murder as he stood there squinting into the sun. Or that his shipmate, sweating in his fo'c'sle bunk, would join him in the bloody enterprise. Or that the trim little ship under them, finging white, curving crests back from her bows, a cloud of canvas bent to the summer breeze, was carrying them through all that long August afternoon nearer and ever nearer to their death. Tomorrow's sun would dry the dark patches of their blood on the white decks, but they were not to know.</p>
				<p>The captain's watch was from eight in the evening to midnight, but the captain, of course, never stood his watch in person, and at half-past nine Captain Selfridge went below and turned in, telling Hughes to call him at twelve o'clock. This left Hughes and Curtis of the captain's watch alone on deck.</p>
				<p>At midnight, at the change of watch, Hughes went forward and called Marchant, who came on deck. Then Hughes went below to call the captain, as he had been ordered to do. Selfridge was asleep, and Hughes wakened him.</p>
				<p>&quot;It's twelve o'clock, sir.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;All right, Hughes. How are we headed?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;East, northeast, sir. No more wind than when you turned in.&quot; The captain stretched himself in his bunk and said nothing more. Hughes went back on deck. Marchant had relieved Curtis at the wheel. Hughes loitered about the deck for some ten minutes, and then, finding that the captain did not come up, he called the mate. Jenkins came on deck.</p>
				<p>&quot;How have we been going, Hughes?&quot; he asked.</p>
				<p>&quot;Wind about the same, sir,&quot; Hughes told him, &quot;holding east, northeast.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;All right, Hughes. You may go below.&quot;</p>
				<p>It was now nearly half-past twelve, and Hughes turned in. As he entered the fo'c'sle he could see both Curtis and Murray in their bunks.</p>
				<p>At about four that morning Murray woke with a start. He had been asleep for some hours. He did not know why he had wakened, but he was frightened. Realizing that the fo'c'sle air was unusually hot and close, he went to the hatch. It was closed. That was strange. He pushed against it, but it did not move. It must be fastened on the outside. Murray felt around the black dark of the fo'c'sle among the bunks and found only Hughes present. Curtis' bunk was empty, but Murray's groping hands found Curtis hat on his seaman's chest. That was stranger still. Murray crept back to his own bunk, the fear of death at his throat.</p>
				<p>Three days later, the American schooner, Sally, out of Newburyport for Labrador, rode at her anchor in the harbor of Louisbourg.</p>
				<p>A hundred years ago, Louisbourg, on the east coast of Cape Breton Island, was as well known to most American sailing masters and their mates as any port on their home coasts. It is the only port on the Atlantic coast of Canada that is free from ice the year round, and because of this and other natural advantages it has been the favored resort of mariners since the days of Queen Elizabeth. Indeed, so well did New England skippers know the port that they once led a siege against the great fortress that France had built there. They set out in the first American Expeditionary Force to capture Louisbourg, and capture it they did. In the eighty years that had elapsed between that capture and the day the Sally rode at anchor off the town Louisbourg had fallen from its high estate. It was no longer a fortified city. Its ramparts had been blown into ruins, and the town existed only as an insignificant fishing village. But its harbor was famous still, British territory, as it is today.</p>
				<p>On that August day, the Sally had put into Louisbourg to fill her water casks.</p>
				<p>Unlike the rugged and beautiful western slope of Cape Breton Island, the Louisbourg coast is low and flat, fog-wrapped much of the year. But on this day the weather was clear. The old clearings of the French occupation were growing up in young spruce trees, and back of these stretched dense woods. Half a dozen fishermen's houses straggled along the shore, some distance apart. One of these, the Slatery house, was the main source of supplies for vessels in port, and it was to call at Slatery's that Mr. Francis Pike, mate of the Sally, had himself rowed ashore in the late afternoon of August 3oth. As he neared the beach Mr. Pike, looking back over his shoulder at the sea, noticed a peculiar craft, a small sailboat carrying a ship's topgallant sail, just entering the harbor. Four men were in her. Mr. Pike's keen seaman's eyes could even distinguish their faces.</p>
				<p>&quot;That's a queer-looking craft,&quot; commented Mr. Pike.</p>
				<p>About a half hour later, while Pike was still at the Slatery's, two of the four men came up to the house.</p>
				<p>They were Marchant and Hughes.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Slatery came forward. Her husband was away from home, but she was equally used to dealing with sailormen. Her brother was mate of a Boston schooner. Jenkins, his name was, Joseph Paine Jenkins.</p>
				<p>&quot;Good-day, ma'am,&quot; said Marchant. &quot;Could you tell me what place this is?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Louisbourg, Cape Breton Island,&quot; Mrs. Slatery told him.</p>
				<p>&quot;Louisbourg,&quot; Marchant repeated. &quot;Near Sydney, that is.&quot; He turned to Pike. &quot;How far would it be to Sydney, sir?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Couldn't tell you that,&quot; Pike answered. &quot;My first trip in these waters.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Perhaps you'd know the course for Halifax?&quot; Mar-chant went on.</p>
				<p>&quot;West by south,&quot; Pike told him. He looked curiously at Marchant and at the weedy, frightened-looking seaman behind him. &quot;Guess they haven't slept for a week,&quot; he thought. Aloud he said, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; </p>
				<p>Marchant told him.</p>
				<p>&quot;He replied,&quot; Pike related afterwards, &quot;that he had been cast away in the brig Fame, Francis Avery, captain and owner, from Philadelphia, bound to Labrador for fish. I asked how large a crew he had. He said that there were eight men, that the captain, mate, and two of the crew took the other boat and were lost sight of in the fog, and that he feared they were lost.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Do you happen to know,&quot; Marchant went on, &quot;of any vessel bound for Halifax?&quot;</p>
				<p>Apparently there was one in the harbor, and Pike pointed her out. Marchant asked Mrs. Slatery if she could sell them some milk.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; she said, &quot;bring a bucket up with you. The girl is just milking.&quot; Poor fellows, she thought—it might have been her brother's ship Fairy, instead of the brig Fame.</p>
				<p>Marchant and Hughes went off, Hughes having hung mute in the background throughout the interview, and fifteen minutes later a third member of the castaways appeared, a bucket in his hand. Pike later recognized him as Curtis.</p>
				<p>To make conversation while Mrs. Slatery fetched the milk, Pike asked the newcomer if he too was one of the shipwrecked crew. Curtis said that he was. He repeated much the same story as had Marchant, but spun of a richer fabric and embellished with descriptions more circumstan-tially ornate.</p>
				<p>&quot;I'm a Danvers man myself,&quot; he said. &quot;The captain belonged to Marblehead. Adams, his rame was. He was a damned rascal too, and as green as a cabbage leaf.&quot; (Curtis had evidently not forgotten the bucket of sea water.) &quot;We've been in that little boat for three days and a half. I'm 'most beat out.&quot;</p>
				<p>He told his tale convincingly—Pike did not then notice the change in the captain's name-and besides, he was an American. Pike was rather taken with him.</p>
				<p>So when Pike went on board his vessel a little later, he spoke to the captain about the strange boat in the harbor and the plight of her crew.</p>
				<p>&quot;There's four of 'em,&quot; he said; &quot;I only saw two-one a limey, the other a Yank.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;I'll go ashore and talk to them in the morning,&quot; Captain Hook (shades of Peter Pan!) replied. &quot;If there are any more Americans among them, I'll give them a passage home.&quot; Meantime, the longboat and her four occupants put off from shore, anchored, and spent the night.</p>
				<p>Not long after sunrise the next morning, Captain Hook went ashore to see what he could do for his distressed fellow countrymen. The four castaways, Marchant and Curtis, Hughes and Murray, were on the beach. Curtis, acting as spokesman this time, told their story once more; the brig Fame, the leak, abandonment at sea, the loss of the other boat.</p>
				<p>&quot;How many of you are Americans?&quot; asked Captain Hook briskly. Curtis and Murray stepped forward, Curtis saying, &quot;I am, sir, and the cook here. Can you give us a passage?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;By all means,&quot; answered Hook. &quot;Take your gear aboard the Sally. Tell Mr. Pike I sent you. Be lively, for I'll sail with the first fair wind.&quot;</p>
				<p>The four adventurers separated forthwith, doubtless only too glad to be rid of each other, Marchant and Hughes to negotiate a passage to Halifax with the master of the British ship, and Curtis and Murray to go aboard the Sally. An hour or so later, when Captain Hook went back on board his ship for breakfast, Mr. Pike had a strange tale to tell.</p>
				<p>Curtis and Murray had come aboard the Sally bringing with them a sea chest, a bag, and two hats. Curtis explained to the mate that the captain had given them leave to come and put their things on board, whereupon Mr. Pike asked where they would have the chest stowed, aft or forward. Curtis looked irresolutely about and then said vaguely:</p>
				<p>&quot;I guess it might stand where it is. I'm going on shore for a few minutes. I'll be right back and will look after it then.&quot;</p>
				<p>Pike thought this curious behavior, as indeed it was, for a shipwrecked mariner, but he said nothing, only moving away and watching the pair from a little distance. He saw Curtis unlock the chest, take out some expensive-looking clothes, put these in the bag, and, taking the bag with him, return to the shore with Murray.</p>
				<p>What had incited Curtis to such an idiotic procedure, throwing away the game when he held it safe in his hand? No one will ever know. It may be that in that instant when Mr. Pike asked his innocent question as to the stowage of the chest, Curtis had realized that it held compromising loot from the Fairy, the clothes of the captain or the mate, perhaps, and that he simply obeyed the blind instinct of fear and guilt that bade him be rid of them at any cost. In any event, his move was fatal. Captain Hook agreed with his mate that the proceeding was very odd, to say the least, and that it had best be looked into at once. He determined to go back on shore and cross-examine the mysterious four.</p>
				<p>&quot;There may have been some difficulty aboard their vessel,&quot; he speculated aloud. &quot;I guess I'll inquire into their story again. If I find it suspicious, I'll take them in charge. If not—why, let them go.&quot;</p>
				<p>One can only hope that Captain Hook waited long enough to have his breakfast, for he was destined to have an exhausting day.</p>
				<p>With Mate Pike and three men, Captain Hook went ashore, landing, presumably to avoid arousing suspicion of pursuit, about a half mile up the beach from the Slatery house, where Curtis had been seen to go.</p>
				<p>They were scarcely ashore when, at a distance of several hundred yards, they saw Murray running towards them. He was out of breath when he reached them, and when he was able to speak at all he stuttered so painfully that he could hardly make himself understood. Murray had been through a lot in the past four days, and now that he had given way to his terror he was in the grip of sheer panic. At last he made Captain Hook understand.</p>
				<p>&quot;You m-must go right away, and t-t-take those two fellows!&quot; he gasped, sobbing with fright. &quot;Curtis and Marchant-they're murderers-they killed the captain and the m-mate! Get Marchant first—he's the worst!&quot; </p>
				<p>And then, quieting a little, he was able to tell Captain Hook that Marchant had gone up to the Old City, the site of the old fortress of Louisbourg, which was three miles away. Captain Hook was a man of action.</p>
				<p>&quot;I'll have those two rascals if it costs me my life!&quot; he snapped. Sending Murray on board the Sally, Hook took his men and started for the Old City by boat, in order to cut off Marchant, who had gone by land. But as the boat passed by the Slatery house, which Curtis had been seen to enter, Curtis himself came out of the door and disappeared round the corner of the building.</p>
				<p>&quot;Put ashore, men!&quot; roared Hook. &quot;That son-of-a-bitch is going to make off!&quot;</p>
				<p>As the keel grounded, the captain jumped for the beach, and at that moment John Hughes also appeared. He had caught the general panic.</p>
				<p>&quot;I'm clear!&quot; he chattered. &quot;I'm clear!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;So I hear,&quot; Hook told him, &quot;but you get into my boat just the same!&quot;</p>
				<p>And then, in the captain's own words, &quot;I then ran as fast as I could after Curtis. He did not run at first, but walked. I now began to think they had agreed to meet each other on the other side of the forest, and after hunting around for half an hour I told my men to go up to the Old City in the boat, and I would go up by land.&quot;</p>
				<p>The two least dangerous of the four were taken, and one notes, parenthetically, that the intrepid Hook starts off in pursuit of two desperate men over an uninhabited stretch of wooded country, without arms of any kind. Times have changed.</p>
				<p>Although the captain started off alone, he took the precaution of picking up three natives as he went along. It was haymaking time, and the men who were not fishing were in the fields. As the little force crossed a field they almost fell over Marchant &quot;lying on a stack of hay&quot; There had been little enough sleep in the Fairy's longboat, the haystack was inviting, and Marchant was exhausted. It was an inglorious finish. The chief mutineer admitted his guilt without more ado.</p>
				<p>Hughes and Marchant were now taken back, three miles, to the Sally, and since Hook was &quot;destitute of authority&quot; in British territory, one of the residents posted off to Sydney for a magistrate, while the search for Curtis went on.</p>
				<p>Captain Hook was joined by eight or ten inhabitants, armed with muskets, and the hunt continued until nightfall without success. The countryside was roused as though by threat of an armed invasion. A company of soldiers sprang from somewhere (presumably Louisbourg had a small garrison at this time, since soldiers could not have come from Sydney so speedily). This force guarded the three men already in custody, and sentineled the shore line, &quot;fearing,&quot; according to Captain Hook, &quot;that Curtis might come down, find a boat, and go off in the night.&quot;</p>
				<p>The next morning the magistrate arrived from Sydney, and the Slatery house, headquarters for these stirring events, buzzed with excited talk. It must have been some time during that day that Mrs. Slatery learned the fate of her brother, Joseph Paine Jenkins, mate of the Fairy.</p>
				<p>A report that a stranger shouldering a bag had been seen taking the Gabarus road the day before sent a detail of troops in hot pursuit and, sure enough, that same evening Curtis was brought in, his identifying bag of fine clothes still on his back. The four were together again.</p>
				<p>In the meantime, Marchant had been questioned by the magistrate. He admitted that the captain and the mate of the Fairy had been murdered, but declared himself the unwilling and intimidated tool of Curtis, asserting passionately that both murders had been committed by Cur-tis, and &quot;that for three days after they were at sea, Curtis had haunted him, Marchant, to kill them both, but that he would not consent to it.&quot; He also said, decently enough, that Hughes and Murray were not involved in any way.</p>
				<p>And then Curtis was brought in to face him, hustled in by weary but triumphant natives, and, looking at Mar-chant, exclaimed:</p>
				<p>&quot;Oh, Charley, if you had only listened to me we should not have come to this!&quot;</p>
				<p>Marchant had no answer.</p>
				<p>Murray, the nineteen-year-old cook, testified later, &quot;Marchant laid all the blame onto Curtis, until Curtis was brought into the house, when he made no reply to what Curtis said, but hung down his head and began to cry.&quot; Here was a brave ending for a bold mutineer!</p>
				<p>There is little enough to choose between this precious pair, but of the two, at this point, Curtis shows in rather the better light. He told a straight story, a story that at least did not conflict with the evidence of Murray and Hughes, and as he told it Marchant did not even try to contradict. &quot;He hung down his head and began to cry.&quot; Unquestionably, the truth of the grim scene on board the Fairy is more nearly arrived at from the versions told before that Louisbourg tribunal than from the defense offered at the trial some months later. For one thing, lawyers had not a chance, at Louisbourg, to mess with the facts in their endeavor to arrive at a verdict. Sifted from the statements of all four men, the story takes us back to that night aboard the Fairy when Marchant was at the wheel in Mate Jenkins' watch, and the ship was holding east by north in a summer sea.</p>
				<p>The mate and Marchant were alone on deck. Marchant, still resentful over his long trick at the wheel, sat down on the cabin skylight to steer. Jenkins came up to him and queried sharply:</p>
				<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Sitting on my backside,&quot; retorted Marchant.</p>
				<p>&quot;Stand up to steer,&quot; the mate ordered curtly, and turned away. He must have turned away, else he would have seen, in time to shout if not to save himself, the murder in Marchant's face, the sudden reach for the concealed ship's ax, and the swift upfling of Marchant's arm.</p>
				<p>Curtis, in his fo'c'sle bunk, heard the thud of the mate's body on the after deck. He may have been expecting it, for everyone else on the schooner slept like the dead. Curtis leaped through the hatch and fastened the scuttle behind him. At any rate, someone fastened it then or later, and it was probably Curtis. Curtis ran aft and found Marchant heaving Jenkins' body over the side. The mate may or may not have been dead. There was a splash, and a dark, bleeding thing that bobbed astern.</p>
				<p>Marchant had tasted blood. He raved with a homicidal frenzy. He picked up a bolt and threatened Curtis. If Curtis didn't go below and kill the captain, Curtis would follow the mate. For stark horror no description can better Curtis own statement, repeated under oath later by Captain Hook. It was made in Marchant's presence, and Marchant, the while he listened, &quot;never opened his mouth.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Curtis stated that he went below with an ax, approached the captain's berth, and his heart failed him. He came back to the steps, and Marchant told him that if he did not kill the captain he, Marchant, would kill him, Curtis. Curtis then returned to the berth of the captain and struck him with an ax, and the captain screamed, 'Mur-der!' Marchant immediately sprang into the cabin and hauled the captain out of his berth; and he, Curtis, killed him on the cabin floor. Then they both dragged him up the steps and pushed him overboard through the porthole.&quot; </p>
				<p>Again bloody bubbles streaked the schooner's white wake and were gone. Young Captain Selfridge and his mate Jenkins had paid for the economies of the brothers Cunningham, asleep in Boston in their tranquil beds.</p>
				<p>Soon after four o'clock that morning, someone unfastened the fo'c'sle hatch, and someone, either Marchant or Curtis, called the watch. Murray, one remembers, had been shivering in his bunk, and though he did not stand watch, he followed Hughes on deck. He knew that something was wrong.</p>
				<p>The scene these two encountered as they emerged from the fo'c'sle hatch was unnerving. Curtis was at the wheel. Marchant sat on the weather rail. There was already enough daylight to show blood on the deck, blood on a port, and blood on Marchant's trousers. As they drew near to Marchant, Hughes said:</p>
				<p>&quot;Where is the mate?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;We have killed the damned rascals and thrown them overboard,&quot; replied Marchant briefly.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Curtis took up the recital. &quot;We have killed the captain and the mate. The devil has got them by this time, and is tormenting them in hell!&quot;</p>
				<p>With this and more bombast, Marchant and Curtis did their best to prove, probably even more to themselves than to the others, what terrible fellows they were. Whereupon, it must have been a little disconcerting to them to have Hughes, who was little more than a lad, begin to cry.</p>
				<p>&quot;You damned fool!&quot; they shouted at him. &quot;What are you crying about?&quot;</p>
				<p>Blubbering with terror, poor Hughes demanded to know why they had committed the murders. He was to testify later that Marchant said they had no cause at all and that he was sorry.</p>
				<p>&quot;Sorry!&quot; Curtis broke in. &quot;What? For killing them two fellows? If they were good men it would be worth while to be sorry! I had as lief kill the two damned rascals as to kill a dog!&quot;</p>
				<p>Hughes' testimony is full of moralizing. It may well be questioned whether, in that dread hour and in his terrified mood, he actually reproached the two murderers for their intention, then expressed, of scuttling the ship because it would be &quot;such a loss to the owners.&quot; One cannot but feel that the interests of the owners occurred to Hughes when his own neck was nearing the noose. But now:</p>
				<p>Hughes continued to weep. Marchant roared at him:</p>
				<p>&quot;What are you crying about all this time?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;It is enough to make any man cry!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Bah! You think a great deal of killing a man! Cry! Look at the old countries, Italians, Portuguese, and Spaniards! They make nothing of killing a man!&quot;</p>
				<p>It was an undeserved aspersion on European morals, but undoubtedly it got on Marchant's nerves to have Hughes sniffling there in the gray morning light.</p>
				<p>They had killed the captain, and they had killed the mate, but they had no plans. Neither had they the brains to make any. If there is any possible evidence in their favor, it lies solely in this lack of plot. Indeed, it was what their defense afterwards claimed, that the murders were the result of a sudden outbreak provoked by the mate, rather than premeditated. But if this were so—how about the captain?</p>
				<p>Marchant, who seems to have hankered for the piratical rôle without having either the brains or the guts to follow it, talked vaguely of heading for the Spanish Main. But the only clear intention, clearly expressed, on this dreadful dawn was Marchant's assertion that he would have a lordly breakfast, &quot;the best the schooner afforded,&quot; served to him on the quarter deck. Murray's hand must have trembled that morning as he sliced the pork extra thick.</p>
				<p>Later in the day, Marchant and Curtis went about staving in water casks and throwing cables and other extra equipment overboard &quot;to make her sail faster.&quot; Then they went down to the cabin, brought up the captain's desk, and went through his letters; still without plan, tearing papers up, putting others back. A dollar and a half, the total sum of money the Fairy carried, was found and pocketed. No special search seems to have been made for more money, nor was any disappointment evinced at finding so small a sum. Like destructive or vicious little boys, they apportioned the captain's clothes and other effects. And then-oh, incredible touch!-they brought the captain's and the mate's pistols on deck, each took a pair, loaded them, and at intervals fired them off at the sea. There is something almost sublime in such futility.</p>
				<p>Marchant, clearly the instigator of the business, seems to have expended both his force and fury in the events of the fatal night. The next morning Curtis begins to emerge as the busier and clearer-headed of the two. He stove water casks and threw spars and sails overboard rather more energetically than did Marchant. Curtis announced that he would be captain, and Marchant retorted that one was as much captain as the other. But Curtis had the last word. He would hail any vessels that might speak them, since, he said, &quot;I am an American!&quot; It would be difficult to find a more perfect exemplification of Dr. Johnson's famous dictum that patriotism is the final refuge of a scoundrel.</p>
				<p>For three terrible days, and nights more terrible, Hughes and Murray stood watch aboard the Fairy under their new masters. Sometimes they steered for Newfound-land, sometimes for Nova Scotia, finally setting their course for the latter coast. One may easily surmise that Hughes and Murray slept uneasily and waked with relief on their watch below. Said Hughes:</p>
				<p>&quot;They told me not to inform of what they had done, but never promised me my life on condition that I would not reveal, and I never expected to get on shore again.&quot; Murray carries on the tale:</p>
				<p>&quot;Three days after the murder, we made land early in the morning. Marchant and Curtis now prepared to scuttle the vessel. They first hove her about, and each taking the auger by turns, bored two holes in the cabin, and two in the forecastle, and plugged them up again. Then they hove about and stood for the shore. When they thought her far enough in, they ordered the boat to be hoisted out and put in her a topgallant sail, the three chests which belonged to Curtis, Hughes, and the captain; and a spyglass, sextant, and compass; also some provisions and liquors. All things being ready, they told me to go on board the boat and pulled the plugs out of the schooner. Curtis now said she would not sink fast enough, and he took the ax and cut a number of holes in her side. Then she began to fill fast, and we left her. The last time I saw her she was nearly hull down. I could not say exactly how many miles off it was; perhaps three or four. As we steered towards the shore, Marchant asked me what I should do. I answered that I should say nothing about what had happened if they would spare my life.&quot;</p>
				<p>The scuttling of the ship must have been almost the most harrowing experience of all for Murray and Hughes. Up to that moment, Marchant and Curtis had needed their help, needed hands on the halyards and food from the galley. In short, Murray and Hughes had been an asset.</p>
				<p>Now they were liabilities, and they knew it. They were merely awkward witnesses now, and—dead men tell no tales. Two bullets or a couple of knife thrusts would have silenced them forever; and if Marchant and Curtis had not been cowards, as well as the murderers that they were, death would have been their portion. No wonder that Hughes never expected to get on shore again. Marchant was later to say that Curtis had wanted to kill them both. Doubtless he did. Curtis was a practical man.</p>
				<p>A light breeze carried them towards land, the while they agreed upon their story; upon the brig Fame, her Philadelphia owners, her captain named Adams, bound to Labrador for a cargo of fish; and by the time they were well set in their parts they were in Louisbourg harbor and, so much stranger is fact than fiction, almost on the doorstep of Mrs. Slatery, sister of Mate Jenkins.</p>
				<p>On shore, Marchant and Curtis entirely lost their heads. They were in continual fear of discovery, in constant terror that Hughes or Murray would give them away. They kept the two lads separated, never left them alone, and reminded them over and again that if they blabbed all of them would hang.</p>
				<p>&quot;For God's sake, don't tell!&quot; Curtis begged them both, &quot;for we shall all be hung if you do.&quot;</p>
				<p>If Marchant and Hughes, the two limeys, had taken passage in the British vessel for Halifax, as there was nothing to prevent them from doing; if Curtis had stowed his chest aboard the Sally, as he stood on her deck with Murray, all four men might have escaped to appear on a new waterfront and to emerge in another fo'c'sle under different names. But the two murderers had the wind up. They panicked, fled, and gave themselves away.</p>
				<p>Soon after the hearing before the magistrate in the Slatery house at Louisbourg, all four were taken to Halifax, and from there the British brig, Chebucto, carried them to Boston to stand their trial.</p>
				<p>And there, in Boston, in the autumn of 1826, Marchant and Curtis were tried, one for the murder of the captain, and the other for that of the mate. Hughes and Murray were accepted as witnesses for the state. When they came to trial, it appeared that Charles Marchant was born John Duncan White; and that Winslow Curtis went also by the name of Sylvester Colson. So—they had already had to change their names at least once before. It was implied that both had bad if not actually criminal records, but the evidence, if any existed, was not admitted. There was no need for it.</p>
				<p>Little was brought out at the formal trials to amplify the story told before the Louisbourg magistrate. There is just a trace of national bias in Hughes' excellent British memory of the guilt of Curtis; in Murray's Yankee certainty that Marchant was the more depraved of the two. Hughes had seen Curtis shift the heaver (a piece of hard-wood, two or three feet long and as many inches round, used to set the halliards) from the stem of the vessel and stow it away in the longboat the night before the murder. Murray remembered that Marchant had asked him, early in the voyage, whether there was any money on board. And it was Hughes who, in the Boston jail, heard Curtis say to Marchant:</p>
				<p>&quot;If you had taken my advice and killed them two damn rascals, we should not have been here now!&quot;</p>
				<p>Curtis was right, but Curtis was a practical man.</p>
				<p>All in all it seems to have been what the police call &quot;an open and shut case,&quot; but in checking over the old trial records one cannot escape from an uneasy feeling that something was being either hushed up or passed over quickly in the hope that it would not be noticed. No answer is given, for example, to the one glaring question that still stands out:</p>
				<p>Why did the brothers Cunningham of Boston send an eighty-foot schooner to sea with a crew of only three men?</p>
				<p>If that question could be answered, it might be illuminating.</p>
				<p>It is not impossible that the secret of the mystery, if there is a mystery, lies in just one sentence that stands out in the cross-examination of young John Murray, cook and steward, who had sailed with Mate Jenkins before. It is a sentence having no relation to the answers preceding it or following it, and it is given in the record without the question that elicited it as an answer. And all it says is,</p>
				<p>&quot;I did not say I was glad when they first told of the murder.&quot;</p>
				<p>It may even be that reasonable provocation might have been proven, but the very life of Boston lay in her sea trade in 1826, and it may not have been thought wise to probe too far.</p>
				<p>Solemnly and in due order, Boston tried Marchant and Curtis. Then it sentenced them, and hanged them by the neck until they were dead.</p>

				<head type="chapter">THE CLUE OF THE DYING DUCKS</head>
				<p>ONE HAS HEARD of a &quot;dying duck in a thunder-storm.&quot; Quite so. But in this instance there was no thunderstorm.</p>
				<p>The 21st of June, 1831, was not only the first day of summer, but it was a very fine day in its own right, or so thought Mr. Benjamin Boutcher as he stood in his door yard and looked reflectively across the fence into that of his neighbor, Mr. William Chapman.</p>
				<p>Mr. Chapman's yard was wet, where some slops had been thrown out of the kitchen door, and a flock of twenty or thirty young ducks were gathered about the wet area, eagerly dipping their yellow bills into the small pools of moisture. Mr. Boutcher regarded the ducks with benevolent pride. It might be Mr. Chapman's yard they were in, but they were his ducks. Mr. Boutcher was glad that he had not mended the broken place in the fence. It was only a small break, so small, indeed, that four ducks, somewhat larger than the others, had not been able to get through, and remained on their home side, quacking dismally.</p>
				<p>The ducks who were regaling themselves by Mr. Chapman's kitchen door finished their repast and dutifully turned to waddle their way home. As they approached the gap in the fence, it seemed to the watching Mr.</p>
				<p>Boutcher that their quacking sounded a little plaintive and that their waddle was curiously ungainly. And then—a duck stopped short, stumbled, fell, struggled convul-sively, and lay still. Another followed, and it was not very long before there were twenty or thirty very dead ducks all lying stiff and stark on the ground. Only the four who had not been able to get through the gap in the fence still quacked in interested animation. Mr. Boutcher was puzzled. He had never known ducks to behave that way before.</p>
				<p>Mr. William Chapman, whose kitchen yard was the scene of this disaster, ran his house as a sort of combination domicile and boarding school, in which he was very ably assisted by his wife Lucretia. The little town of Andalusia, where these events took place, is only fifteen miles or so from the great city of Philadelphia and, as everyone knows, Philadelphia has always prided itself on its cultural ad-vantages, so that, naturally, some of the excess culture spilled over into Andalusia, only a short distance away. It was this excess culture that Mr. Chapman and his wife Lucretia represented.</p>
				<p>The school, while successful enough, was very small, never boasting more than a dozen pupils at one time, and usually not having more than two or three. William Chapman was one of the early specialists in the teaching of those who have impediments in their speech, stuttering, stammering, and the like, and through his own methods he had been notably successful in clearing away these de-fects. He devoted himself to his chosen line while Lucretia attended to the more general teaching and more or less ran the school. The arrangement worked very well. Chapman was quite widely known through the pamphlets he published on his work, and the little school was able to command a fair price for those it took in. The Chapmans were a comfortable, middle-aged, well-to-do coupie.</p>
				<p>But Mr. Boutcher was not thinking of these things on that warm June afternoon, as he stood looking mournfully down at his dead ducks. Rather he was meditating on a whole series of curious events that had taken place in the Chapman house over a period of six weeks past.</p>
				<p>It was just at dusk on a Monday afternoon, the 9th of May, that a stranger came to the door of the Chapman house and asked for a night's lodging. Ellen Shaw, one of the hired help, as servants used to be called in the country, was milking the cow in the yard when he came, and she called away the dog who was about to do his duty. It is quite possible that, if Ellen had not performed this kindly act, the sovereign state of Pennsylvania would have been spared the heavy expense of two trials for murder. How-ever... I The stranger, who Ellen noticed was young, shabby, and by no means ill looking in a dark, foreign sort of way, was humbly making his way around to the kitchen door when Ellen called him back, explaining that there was no one in the kitchen at the moment, and bidding him go up on the &quot;front piazza&quot; and knock on the door there. This the stranger did and, having been admitted to the house, was conducted to the schoolroom where Mr. and Mrs. Chapman were engaged in instructing their young charges. Here the stranger repeated his request for a night's lodging, voicing his appeal with an engaging foreign accent. It was not an unusual request in those days, any more than it is today in a sparsely settled country, but while Mr. Chapman was quite accustomed to sheltering a stray traveler, even setting aside a special room for the purpose, some instinct made him hesitate. Observing this, the young stranger explained that he had been turned away at the tavern just below—why, he did not say. Mrs. Chapman now broke in cordially, assuring him that they would gladly put him up for the night. And still William Chapman hesitated, warned by some curious foreboding, only suggesting that there was a tavern above as well as below the house. But on this Lucretia Chapman's outraged sense of hospitality-if it was that-rose in revolt, and the dark and handsome young stranger was conducted upstairs to a room.</p>
				<p>It is a curious little scene the young man in his shabby clothes, with his expressive gestures and his alluring accent; the wondering, goggle-eyed children, sitting on their school benches; and the middle-aged, uneasy school-master, dominated by his buxom wife. Certainly, it was the opening scene of a far more curious drama.</p>
				<p>That night, when the children were all safely in bed and only the soft noise of the tree toads and crickets broke the quiet of the June evening, the stranger told his story, a story so astonishing and so romantic that it left William and Lucretia as wondering and as goggle-eyed as their pupils had been before them.</p>
				<p>His name, said the stranger, was Don Lino Amalia Esposimina, and his father was his Excellency Don Antonio Mara Esposimina, Governor of the Province of California on behalf of the Republic of Mexico! The Chapmans gasped delightedly. Romance itself in the person of this shabby young man was seated in their little parlor. What a day this was! According to Lino, as the Chapmans soon learned to call him, he had left California some time before in the company of an English doctor who had cured Don Lino's millionaire grandfather of a disease of the lungs. (Just what this mysterious disease was remains both vague and unimportant, but it is interesting to note that little Lucretia Chapman, aet. 10, testified later that, &quot;His grandfather had a skin growing over his lungs. The doctor gave him something to make him sleep, and then cut open his side, took the skin off his lungs, and closed it up again.&quot;) Lino and the doctor had sailed from Vera Cruz for France, the journey having been arranged by the grateful grandfather to enable Lino to make the &quot;grand tour&quot; under the guidance of the older man. Within a few days after their arrival in Paris, however, the English doctor dropped dead in church—a very decent setting for his decease —and Lino was left friendless and alone in a strange land. A Spaniard who was in the congregation took Lino back to his hotel, and &quot;in a few minutes after&quot; the English consul came to his room and removed all his belongings, both Lino's and the dead doctor's, saying that Lino had been only the English doctor's &quot;slave.&quot;</p>
				<p>Lino was now destitute—it doesn't seem to have occurred to him to appeal to his own consul—and besought a fellow guest at the hotel to advise him. This generous fellow not only gave him the advice he asked, urging him to go home to Mexico at once, but pressed upon him one hundred dollars as the means to follow it. So Lino sailed for Boston, remembering that he had a relative there, and &quot;having heard that his grandfather had money in a bank in that place.&quot; But, alas, on arriving in Boston, he found that his &quot;relative&quot; had gone to Mexico with a lady he had just married, and the money in the bank was not forth-coming. Then, &quot;not being acquainted with the English language, he determined to come on to New York&quot; in search of a friend he had made during his sadly brief stay in France. The name of this friend was Casanova, but whether this was the famous Casanova of the Memoirs, who had been dead for thirty-four years, Lino did not say. The Memoirs were certainly not read in the Chapman family. At any rate, Signor Casanova was not in New York, but Lino was informed that Joseph Bonaparte of Bordentown, New Jersey, knew where to find him. Straightway, Lino set off for Bordentown, but by the time he reached Philadelphia his money had given out, and he had been compelled that day to walk as far as the Chap-mans' on his journey to Bordentown.</p>
				<p>There was just one fact in this farrago upon which the dazed minds of the Chapmans could seize. Joseph Bona-parte, ex-King of Naples and the older brother of Napo-leon, did actually live at Bordentown, not more than twenty miles or so away. He had assumed the title of Count—to which he certainly had at least as much right as a good many others who have assumed it—had married an American lady, and had settled down on the banks of the Delaware River to live his life far from the strifes of Europe. His Bordentown place was naturally the Mecca of many distinguished foreigners. That much the Chap-mans did know and, somehow, the knowledge that that one small item was true cast a halo of veracity over the whole story. It is by no means an uncommon error— as a great many impostors could testify.</p>
				<p>It may be thought that William and Lucretia Chapman were absurdly credulous in swallowing Lino's tale, as they did, hook, line and sinker. There is this to be said for them, however. The isolation of the individual was far greater in those days than it is today. The Chapmans had no daily paper, no telephone, no telegraph to relay them the news. Railroads were few and very far between. To ride on one was an adventure. The post was carried by slow-moving, horse-drawn stages. Indeed, they were cut off from the world, not to mention the flesh and the devil, to an extent that we today are hardly able to appreciate. And, too, there is another factor to be considered: Into the humdrum life of this middle-aged schoolmaster and his mate there had been, all of a sudden, injected the sweet poison of romance. A mysterious stranger, young, handsome, wealthy, exotic, had come to their humble door begging a lodging for the night. In his own person he brought to them something of the glitter of the world of which they had only read-California, a magic name even then, the splendid court of the governor, silver mines in far-off Mexico, the glamour of foreign travel and great names and, finally, the pathos of misfortune. Small wonder that this out-at-elbows adventurer appeared to them in the guise of a fairy prince, and that their voices held almost a note of awe as they bade each other good-night and crept upstairs to talk until the moonlight faded into dawn on that warm night in May. The only pity is that their disillusion must come so soon and so tragically.</p>
				<p>The next morning, that of Tuesday the 1ith, the Chap-mans pressed their guest to stay another day in order to rest and recruit his strength. On Wednesday, Lucretia would herself drive him over to the Bonaparte house in Bordentown, where his rich friend, Casanova, was doubtless staying. Then, but only then, would they be ready to give him godspeed. To this plan Lino graciously consented, and forthwith borrowed a clean shirt of William.</p>
				<p>Wednesday morning, directly after breakfast, the horse was hitched to the carriage &quot;with the fall-back top,&quot; and Lino, in his borrowed shirt, with Lucretia, who was dressed in her best, we may be sure, set out for Bordentown. Mr. Ash, unidentified, but probably one of the several servants about the place, drove the carriage. Arriving at the Bona-partes' without mishap, they found, to their regret, that &quot;the Count&quot; was entertaining important guests and could see no one. A servant told them, however, in reply to a question, that there had been several foreign gentlemen staying at the house, but that they had left for parts unknown a day or two before. Among these foreign gentle-men, Lino had no difficulty whatever in recognizing his beloved friend Casanova. This was a setback, to be sure, but Lino's loss was Lucretia's gain, or so she interpreted it, and back they drove to Andalusia and to William.</p>
				<p>Of that long drive home there is no record, but from the evidence of later events we are able to reconstruct it with reasonable accuracy. To say that Lino was what is now known as &quot;a fast worker&quot; begs the question, for no matter how zealously or how fast he worked, it might easily have availed him little had he not had ideal material to work on sitting close beside him in the carriage with the &quot;fall-back top.&quot; We only know that so artfully did Lino spin his web of glamour during those twenty miles that at their end the bemused and enchanted Lucretia rushed to her astounded husband with the glad tidings that Lino had consented to make his home with them for the next three years and that he was to pay Lucretia $2,000 a year in return for teaching him proper English! If she had paid him twice that to teach her the rudiments of caution and common sense it would have been a fairer bargain.</p>
				<p>William was far from pleased, and the servants openly sniffed.</p>
				<p>It is a pity that there are not extant more details of Lino's technique in consolidating his position in the Chapman house during the days that followed. Truly, the man must have spoken with &quot;the tongues of men or of angels,&quot; or devils, more properly.</p>
				<p>William Chapman frankly did not like the situation, and his discontent grew daily, but his plaintive protests were ridden down, roughshod, by his wife. It was not that he disbelieved in Lino or in his claims, but simply that the overwhelming infatuation of Lucretia for the youth was so open that it could not be disregarded. Chapman should have thrown young master Lino out bodily. He did not dare. Lucretia would have gone with him. William evidently decided to make the best of a very bad business. He did, however, complain that he would soon have no shirts left. In response to this, Lucretia &quot;pushed him with her foot.&quot;</p>
				<p>On the following Monday, the 16th, William and Lucretia Chapman wrote, each of them, a letter, which epistles testify to the continuance of their dazed condition —that or Lucretia's will power. William addressed his missive to his Excellency the Governor of the Province of California, Don Antonio Mara Esposimina, while Lucretia directed hers, in proud and fluent Spanish, Para la Sn. Dn. Maria de Calme Mirones, en la Republica y Ciudad de Mexico-it being understood that Lino's parents, while not estranged, were living apart at the time. The gist of the letters was the same, but there were certain significant differences. They both start by explaining that Lino is their guest, but while William says, &quot;He will continue here until he hears from you,&quot; Lucretia openly re-marks, &quot;Your son talks of spending three years in my house, which I hope he will do.&quot; William encloses one of his pamphlets on the correction of defective speech; says that he has had four hundred and eleven pupils of both sexes; and asks the Governor to give him some local publicity in California, &quot;should your station allow you to do so.&quot; Lucretia, as might be expected, is much more personal. She says of Lino that &quot;His manners are so mild and en-gaging, that he wins the affections of everyone in the house, even our youngest child (a little boy three years old) is delighted to remain with him while taking our meals at the table.&quot; This charming picture of domestic felicity, along with its punctuation, concludes with &quot;You may rest assured, Madam, that parental attentions shall be extended to him by myself and husband.&quot; Lucretia certainly spoke out of turn, so far as her husband was concerned, and if she fondly imagined that her attentions were parental she used English too loosely for a teacher.</p>
				<p>The next thing was to have the letters delivered, and that could best be done by putting them in the hands of Colonel Cuesta, the consul for Mexico in Philadelphia. Accordingly, Lino, Lucretia, and her small son William set out for Philadelphia on the Wednesday following. (William must have been left in someone's care during the day in the city, for he was not active in what happened.) </p>
				<p>Between twelve and one o'clock on Wednesday there appeared at the office of the Mexican Consul, in Union Street, a young gentleman of undoubted Spanish extraction accompanied by a somewhat older American lady. Being admitted to Colonel Cuesta, and having introduced themselves, the conversation between Lino and the consul proceeded in Spanish, a discourtesy to Mrs. Chapman which was excused only by the exigencies of the situation.</p>
				<p>Lino, by the consul's own testimony, told the same story he had told the Chapmans a few days before, ending up by asking Colonel Cuesta to forward the letters which he gave him. To this the wary Colonel replied that Lino's tale was like that of a fish, scaly, and that his manners and language were both far from being those of an aristocrat. Lino shrugged, admitted regretfully that his education had been shamefully neglected, and said that was the very reason his grandfather had sent him to Francethe land of culture. At this, the Colonel looked a little blank and replied that he had no knowledge of &quot;any governor&quot; in California named Esposimina. This, Lino waved to one side, merely remarking that what he knew of his father had come to him through his grandfather, and that he could not vouch for the details. His father held some high position: that was all he knew. In what city did his father live? He could not be sure. Where was his mother? In the City of Mexico. But, being queried about that city, it was clear that he had never even been there, and the consul bluntly told him so. Another shrug. His recent troubles, the loss of his friend and his money, had almost deranged him. It was but natural. Had he any means of identifica-tion, a passport, for example? No, his passport had been taken from him in France along with his other papers, including his certificate of baptism, for which Colonel Cuesta next asked. The consul gave up his fruitless cross-examination and said that he would make inquiries of the American Consul at Vera Cruz. Lino acquiesced and asked permission to write a short note to his mother.</p>
				<p>At this juncture, Lucretia, who had been waiting proudly and patiently through this interrogation, without the faintest idea what it was all about, rose and said that she had remembered some business she had to attend to, but that she would be back in an hour. The gentlemen bowed politely, and she departed on her errand.</p>
				<p>After some time had passed and Lucretia had not re-turned, the consul, realizing that his dinner hour was at hand, made the perfunctory gesture of asking Lino to dine with him. It was a mere politeness-as when a Spaniard assures you that his house is yours, although he does not expect you to rush out and put a mortgage on the property—but to Colonel Cuesta's disgust Lino accepted the invitation heartily, and the two went next door, where the consul was living. Lino was introduced to Colonel Cuesta's family, and they sat down to dinner. In a few minutes, however, a servant announced that Mrs. Chapman was in the drawing room but would be glad to wait until they were through. The consul pressed her to join them, but when she persisted in her refusal he sent his sister, &quot;who could speak a little English,&quot; to keep her company. The conversation between the sister and Lucretia was brief and was restricted to courteous ameni-ties, but the two accounts vary. Lucretia afterwards insisted that Señorita Cuesta thanked her for giving shelter to a Spanish gentleman who was a person of importance in his own country. The Señorita, however, said that she had been by no means so flat-footed—that she had spoken of Lino as a Spaniard &quot;who said he was&quot; a gentleman and the son of the governor. The misunderstanding was, of course, partly racial; the matter-of-fact Anglo-Saxon mind versus the politely devious Latin. Partly, it was the fault of the Señorita's broken English. But most of all, it arose through Lucretia's romantic infatuation that automatically translated whatever was said of her hero into terms best suited to support her estimate of him. The episode has been treated fully here, because it was of enormous help to Lino in authenticating his position, and because it shows how cannily Fate moves her puppets through minor hazards into deeper ones. Why was not Colonel Cuesta perfectly frank with Lucretia, telling her of the unsatisfactory interview and of his suspicions? If he had been, this story might well have had a very different ending. He probably thought that it was none of his busi-ness, and, moreover, distances were great, communications were slow, and there was a greater possibility of error than there is today. Doubtless, at the moment, the Colonel figured that there might be something in Lino's claims, and was unwilling to brand the man openly as an impostor until he was entirely sure of his facts. His caution was to make all the difference between life and death, but that he could not know.</p>
				<p>&quot;This took place on a Wednesday, but Lino and Lucretia did not turn up again in Andalusia until Friday afternoon. Where they stayed, and just how far their intimacy progressed during that period, we can only conjecture.</p>
				<p>Months later, Lino volunteered the statement that Lucretia did not actually become his mistress until some time after this date, and it may be that he told the truth, especially since he had no conceivable reason for lying, but having regard to the manifest change in their relationship after the Philadelphia excursion, it seems highly probable that wherever the two stayed, they stayed to-gether. Clearly, Lino had been working in that direction, for it would give him just the hold he needed.</p>
				<p>It was probably during this visit too that Lucretia and Lino called again on Colonel Cuesta, and were entertained by his sister, the Colonel himself being, perhaps advisedly, indisposed; but it was a week or two later, when Lino was in Philadelphia alone for the day, that he met the consul on Chestnut Street and, having accosted him, was informed bluntly by that gentleman that, thereafter, he would not be recognized or received at the Colonel's house, that he was an impostor and that &quot;his conduct was very wrong.&quot; It seems a singularly mild rebuke. And, whatever Colonel Cuesta's opinion was, he certainly kept it strictly to himself, a proceeding which may have been according to the best usages of diplomacy, but which was as astonishing as it was unfortunate.</p>
				<p>Lucretia did find time to go into Richard Watkinson's tailoring establishment, patronized by William Chapman, and order some clothes for Lino, which she directed to be put on her husband's bill. There is small point in being a Spanish hidalgo if one cannot dress the part.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, in Andalusia, William Chapman was almost literally tearing his hair. Lucretia and Lino had left on Wednesday morning to be gone only for the day; and here it was Friday, and they had not returned. According to the testimony given later by Ellen Shaw, one of the servants:</p>
				<p>&quot;At the time that Mina and Mrs. Chapman were absent three days, Mr. Chapman did nothing but run about the house like a crazy man. He cried. He said he did not know what to make of it. I told him, maybe they had gone to Mexico, for they had talked about it. He said he should not be surprised if they did run off together, the way they were going on. He said he wished the ship had sunk that he [Lino] came over in.&quot;</p>
				<p>William also said, with high significance, that &quot;he was really afraid there would be murder either on his own side or on Mina's.&quot; And yet—when the truants did come home, &quot;bringing their tails behind them,&quot; William's feeble attempt at protest was promptly drowned by Lucretia's calm assertion that &quot;she would be mistress in her own house!&quot;</p>
				<p>Was there ever a more ineffectual man!</p>
				<p>From now on Lino and Lucretia made little effort to conceal their &quot;goings on.&quot; In any event, it would have been difficult for them to do so, for during all the time that these events were taking place the Chapman house was full of people visitors, male and female servants, and children. There seem always to have been at least five or six persons of assorted sexes, ages, and conditions of servitude on hand, and usually there were more. That the two lovers, for we may as well call them that, were able to hide even as much as they did is distinctly remarkable. There was enough and more to appease the appetite of the most zestful snooper.</p>
				<p>A veritable tally was kept of their kisses, and on the occasion when Lucretia was seen in her nightgown sitting on the edge of Lino's bed, the invisible audience all but cheered. There was the day, again Ellen Shaw is telling the story, when she and Lino and Lucretia drove over to Joseph Wright's for a short visit. It was about seven miles away, and &quot;nearly all the way he was lying in Mrs. Chapman's lap singing love songs.&quot; And after they got to the Wrights', Lino and Lucretia wandered in the woods together, still singing. The only phrase that seems to cover the situation is-Can you beat it? On the drive home, Lino was &quot;taken with one of his spells, and had to get into the back seat where he soon got better.&quot;</p>
				<p>Up to this point, any account of Lino's so-called &quot;spells&quot; has been omitted because, while they were made much of a few months later, they appear, in fact, to have been simply a part of his stock in trade in deception. There is no record that he ever had fits either before meeting Lucretia or after parting from her, and while it would be unjust to center the blame for these seizures on that romantic lady, there can be little doubt that Lino's &quot;spells&quot; were a mere theatrical device, calculated to evoke sympathy. Certainly, he never seems to have had a &quot;fit&quot; unless Lucretia was within sight and hearing.</p>
				<p>On May 28th, Lino, being a trifle indisposed, took advantage of the occasion to make his will or, at any rate, to write and sign an informal testamentary document leaving Lucretia the sum of $15,000. A note on the margin of this brave fancy changed the sum to $1,500,000, and it is entirely typical of Lucretia's mental state that she evidently read the marginal notation with more care than the body of the note. So far as Lino was concerned, Lucretia always took the highest valuation. If he had offered her a string of glass beads she might have suspected his intentions, but when he bestowed a million and a half dollars upon her, and spoke of sending to Mexico for the family jewels and a silver mine or two, Lucretia accepted it as a matter of course. That, to her mind, was the natural and proper way for a Spanish grandee to behave.</p>
				<p>During the next several weeks nothing of particular importance happened. The situation at the Chapman house increased in intensity and absurdity, Lino and Lucretia frisking, gamboling, and generally disporting themselves, while William looked on in fretful discontent and disapproval. Lino was rapidly getting bored. There can be no doubt of that. His passionate but middle-aged charmer was quite unversed in the arts of holding a lover —especially one whose mind was centered on the cash box-and, consequently, flung herself at him with a lavish abandon that a more experienced woman would have scorned.</p>
				<p>On the 8th of June, Lino journeyed in to Philadelphia to break the monotony and to stay overnight. It was many weeks later when Lucretia found a discarded hotel bill, reading:</p>
				<p>Mr. Amalio To B. Renshaw</p>
				<p>1831 July 8 to 9</p>
				<p>Board for self and 2 ladies $3.00</p>
				<p>Use of private parlor 1.00</p>
				<p>$4.00</p>
				<p>That helped to open Lucretia's eyes—too late. So Lino had his little amusements—inexpensive but always noble.</p>
				<p>On or about June 14th an incident took place that does considerable credit to Lino's constructive imagination. It was the prelude to the great scene.</p>
				<p>It must have been on a Monday or Tuesday, June 13th or 14th, that little Lucretia Chapman, her mother's name-sake, was wandering out near the barn when she saw Lino leaning up against the building weeping bitterly. Lucretia asked him what the matter was, not being accustomed to see her elders dissolved in tears, and Lino replied, his voice broken with sobs, that all of a sudden he had heard two mysterious voices that seemed to come to him out of the very air, and which called to him, saying, &quot;Linetto!-Linetto!Linetto!&quot; The melodious accents of these unseen speakers were unmistakably those of his mother and his youngest sister, one or both of whom, opined Lino, was surely dead. With this remarkable visitation from the unknown as a lever, Lino managed to pry loose from poor William Chapman an order on his tailor in Philadelphia for a complete suit of black. It may be thought that his mourning was premature, but that matters little-Lino got his new suit.</p>
				<p>To precisely what extent the events of the next few days were planned, premeditated, and whether this premeditation was Lino's alone or whether it involved Lucretia with him, is a point that was bitterly contested at the time of the trial. The jury made its decision, but the voice of a jury is not the voice of God, and whether or not the verdict was correct can never be known. The account of the crime, as here set forth, is far more complete than the account which was given to the jury of 1832, however, and the opinion of the reader of today will be the more valuable, both because of that fact and for the reason that the lapse of a full century is surely sufficient to remove any emotional bias that may have once existed. In any event:</p>
				<p>On June 15th, Lino went in to Philadelphia to get his suit of mourning could it have been that his macabre imagination suggested that he wear mourning for the person he was about to murder?—and to do several other, more important errands.</p>
				<p>Oddly enough, William Chapman's tailor was not entirely satisfied with the note from Chapman that Lino brought him and sent a message to Colonel Cuesta asking whether Lino was to be trusted. The Colonel promptly sent back word that, in his opinion, the man was an im-postor, but none the less-Lino got his suit. Colonel Cuesta's policy was, apparently, to come out with the truth only in reply to a direct question; and this question neither William nor Lucretia had ever asked. Here is a chance more slender than the hangman's noose, but not less deadly.</p>
				<p>From the talloring shop, Lino made his way along the cobbled streets of Philadelphia to the drug store owned by Elias Durand, at the corner of Sixth and Chestnut streets. One of Mr. Durand's assistants, a Mr. Guillou, could both speak and write Spanish, and it was with him, naturally, that Lino chose to deal.</p>
				<p>First, Lino asked Guillou whether he had any &quot;arsenical soap&quot; which was used for the purposes of taxidermy-Lino said that he wanted to stuff some birds. Guillou said that they had not, but that they could prepare it. That was useless, said Lino, and asked the price of powdered white arsenic. This having been given him, he bought one shilling's worth, a quarter of a pound. Then he went away, only to return that same afternoon.</p>
				<p>On this second visit, Lino asked Guillou if he would write a letter for him from Lino's dictation. Guillou consented, and Lino dictated a letter to William Chapman warmly endorsing &quot;my friend Mr. Lino Amalio Esposimina,&quot; and this he signed &quot;Est. Cuesta.&quot; During this visit, Lino wore a pair of false whiskers, but whom they were intended to deceive remains a mystery, for he even took the trouble to explain to the interested Guillou just how they were fastened on.</p>
				<p>And then, having his quarter pound of powdered arsenic and his forged letter of recommendation, Lino returned to Andalusia in the afternoon coach. It had been a productive day. It was the 16th of June when Lino bought the arsenic.</p>
				<p>On Friday the 17th William Chapman became violently ill.</p>
				<p>This took place on Friday evening. For dinner that day the family had had baked veal, boiled pork, and green peas. There were six or seven at table, and everyone ate heartily, but the only one to suffer evil consequences was William, who woke up, torn with nausea, during the night. Lucretia &quot;went to get the peppermint, but could not find it,&quot; and the next morning, when she wanted to send for the doctor, William refused, saying that &quot;the doctor would only give him medicine, and he had cholera morbus drops in the house.&quot;</p>
				<p>On Sunday morning, Lino went before breakfast to get Dr. Phillips, who came shortly afterwards and ordered a light diet of chicken and broth. By this time, Chapman's symptoms had slackened in intensity, and Dr. Phillips diagnosed the case as a simple upset stomach.</p>
				<p>On Monday, both the chicken and the broth were pre-pared, and that afternoon they were taken upstairs to William, who barely tasted the soup, but ate greedily of the chicken. Young Lucretia Chapman later testified that she had taken the remains of the repast downstairs, and that only &quot;the neck, wing, and part of the back of the chicken were left.&quot; As she was going through the dining room on her way to the kitchen, her mother remarked, &quot;How heartily your pa has eaten of the chicken, and how little of the soup! I am afraid it will hurt him.&quot; She was right. It did.</p>
				<p>That same night William Chapman was taken more violently ill than before.</p>
				<p>On Tuesday, Dr. Allen Knight was substituted for Dr. Phillips, no one knows why. Dr. Knight was puzzled. He prescribed calomel, to which both William and Lucretia objected and, after observing that the patient's extremities were very cold, that he complained of a burning sensation in the stomach, and that his face was &quot;dark,&quot; he left. On Wednesday morning he returned to find William delirious and &quot;almost entirely deaf.&quot; Dr. Knight gave up the case, in effect, and Dr. Phillips returned.</p>
				<p>From this time on, William Chapman sank steadily.</p>
				<p>It was on this day too, Tuesday, the 21st of June, that the curious incident of Mr. Boutcher's dying ducks, with which this story opens, took place. The ducks fed on the remains of the chicken and soup that had been thrown out the kitchen door.</p>
				<p>Some time between nine and eleven on Wednesday evening, Mr. Boutcher was &quot;called,&quot; heaven alone knows for just what purpose, since the Chapman house was already full of people. Boutcher took Chapman's hand and asked him how he felt, but the now dying man could only squeeze his hand in return, without replying. Dr. Phillips was there, and also Lucretia, Lino, and one or two others.</p>
				<p>Once, during the night, when Boutcher and Lino were alone with William, Lino &quot;took out his watch, and said that Mr. Chapman's pulse beat 55 to a minute after a while, he said that it beat 45.&quot; Surely, the murderer who can calmly count the flagging pulse beats of his dying victim deserves a niche to himself in the great Hall of Infamy.</p>
				<p>A little before midnight Lucretia said that she was worn out with watching and would go and lie down for a while. Dr. Phillips followed her example. At about two o'clock, William was failing fast, and Boutcher called Lucretia and Dr. Phillips, going himself to rest a little. In an hour or so, between three and four, when human vitality ebbs away to whatever sea provides its source, William Chapman died.</p>
				<p>Boutcher was called, went downstairs and closed William's staring eyes, tying up his slack jaws with a handkerchief after the traditional manner. It struck Mr. Boutcher as being strange that rigor mortis set in almost at once.</p>
				<p>Lino came in and shaved the corpse!</p>
				<p>Friendly neighbors helped make preparations for the funeral, which was held on Friday, June 24th, the day after William's death. The condition of the body did not permit a longer delay.</p>
				<p>A Mrs. Sarah Palethorpe seems to have assumed charge of affairs, and, according to her version, she suggested to Lucretia that there ought to be &quot;some person to walk with her from the carriage to the grave.&quot; Lucretia an-swered, &quot;Why would not Don Lino do?&quot; Mrs. Palethorpe was very properly shocked. She said that Lino was &quot;a stranger and under size,&quot; and advised that he walk with Mary, the oldest daughter. This was done, and Dr. Knight gave his arm to Lucretia.</p>
				<p>So William Chapman, poisoned by his own futility as much as by arsenic, was buried in the little churchyard of All Saints on the Bristol Turnpike. No one suspected murder.</p>
				<p>That was the end of Act One.</p>
				<p>The multiplicity of small happenings that took place more or less immediately after William Chapman's burial may be passed over briefly. There is a confusion in the trial records and in the various contemporary accounts of the case, not so much as to what took place as to the order of its occurrence. One event, however, of which there are two conflicting accounts, is important.</p>
				<p>According to Lucretia's statement, a few days after William's death Lino came to her and said, &quot;Lino has one heart. Lino never forgets a favor. If you will marry me, I will take you to Mexico, and my mother will never forget what you have done. She has gold mines there, and you shall share a part of them.&quot; Lucretia, becomingly shy, replied, &quot;Lino, would it not be more proper for you to marry my daughter Mary?&quot;With an impassioned gesture, the gallant Spaniard answered, &quot;No! It is you, Mrs. Chapman, that I wish to possess. It was you that took me in your door, not knowing who I was!&quot; Lucretia, still by her own story, hesitated at the impropriety of marrying again so soon after her husband's death, but Lino assured her &quot;that it would be thought nothing of in Mexico&quot;; and that they could be married in New York, getting Lucretia's sister, Mrs. Green, who lived near Syracuse, to look after the property in Andalusia while they themselves went on to Mexico to—well, to cash in on a few gold and silver mines, pick up the family jewels, and return in state. The prospect was attractive. Lucretia consented.</p>
				<p>Lino's version of this incident was, as might have been expected, somewhat different. The gospel according to Lino was, &quot;Mrs. Chapman come, kiss and hug me, and say, Lino, I want you to marry me.' I say, 'No, not till I ask my father.' She say, 'Oh, yes, I love you so much.?' Then I say, 'Well, when Mr. Chapman get bury, then I will marry you' Then she say, 'We get marry in New York.'&quot;</p>
				<p>It is difficult to choose between two people both of whom are lying to save their necks.</p>
				<p>Whatever the truth of the matter was, it is certainly a fact that Lino and Lucretia went to New York and were married by Bishop Onderdonk of the Episcopal Church on July 5th, less than two weeks after William Chapman's death.</p>
				<p>That same day Lucretia took the boat up the Hudson to Albany and points north to take back the Green family, and Lino returned to Andalusia to look after the house and children. There was no honeymoon. There never was any.</p>
				<p>Lucretia wrote to her Lino twice while she was away, once from Albany and once from Syracuse. The letters are tenderly affectionate, and full of accounts of her journey and her arrival at Clay, New York, where her sister lived, but there is not so much as a single phrase to indicate that the two shared any guilty knowledge! Is it possible that Lucretia actually did not know what had been done?</p>
				<p>About the 13th of the month Lucretia arrived back in Andalusia with Mrs. Green. Disillusionment awaited her, but with the tragic tenacity of the deceived woman she hugged her deception the closer and clung to her dream.</p>
				<p>No sooner was she home than Lucretia missed a large number of William's books and all of her silver spoons. Lino explained. While she had been away no less a personage than the Minister from Spain had called at the house, and Lino, with true Spanish hospitality, wishing to give him some souvenir, had presented him with a trunk full of books. As for the silver spoons, &quot;a black woman had taken them.&quot; Lino had pursued the black woman to Philadelphia, but he hadn't got the spoons. So that was all right.</p>
				<p>And then there was the matter of the chain.</p>
				<p>One day, in the middle of July, Lino asked Lucretia to give him her watch, and upon Lucretia's reminding him that he already had William's-he having constituted himself heir to that gentleman-he replied that he wished especially for Lucretia's watch &quot;as a memento of regard.&quot; Mementos of regard that had also an intrinsic value always appealed to Lino. As Lucretia still hesitated, Lino took from his pocket a chain, apparently of gold, and handed it to her with the words, &quot;This is a chain that a friend of mine gave me. I give it to you in return for the watch.&quot; The exchange was made, and Lino went off for one of his little jaunts to Philadelphia, incidentally taking with him all the money in the house.</p>
				<p>The next day Lucretia noticed that the chain irritated her neck and, simultaneously with this discovery, she discovered on the mantelpiece the hotel bill, which we have already seen, for Lino and two ladies. This was too much! Lucretia went herself to Philadelphia, had the chain tested, found that it was brass, and when she got home told her sister that she hoped she never would see Lino again. It was a pious wish, but no sooner was it made than Lino walked in, smiling and urbane as ever.</p>
				<p>Lucretia turned on him dramatically, and said in the best tragic manner, &quot;Lino, leave me!&quot; to which he replied:</p>
				<p>&quot;What is the matter? If an angel from heaven had come and told me a wife of mine would behave so, I would not have believed it!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Lino, the chain you gave me is not gold!&quot; </p>
				<p>He shrugged. &quot;If your affections are so slender as a chain, I can explain that to you. When I gave you the chain I told you a friend of mine had given it me. That friend might have deceived me or might have been deceived himself.&quot;</p>
				<p>Lucretia shifted her attack and demanded that he explain the bill from the City Hotel for himself and two &quot;ladies.&quot; To this Lino replied that he had been under the arcade of the hotel when a shower came up. The ladies had asked him for an umbrella. He had none and, in an excess of gallantry, had offered them his hospitality in the hotel until the rain was over. There was never anything wanting in Lino's hospitality. The conversation continued by Lucretia saying,</p>
				<p>&quot;Lino, my sister is not at all satisfied with this con-duct.&quot;</p>
				<p>Said he, &quot;We had better be separated, then. I find I have more wives than one to please.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;The sooner the better!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Remember, Mrs. Chapman, before I go I must tell you something.&quot;</p>
				<p>Lucretia asked what this something was. &quot;I cannot tell you in the presence of your sister,&quot; said Lino. &quot;If you will come into the other room I will tell you.&quot;</p>
				<p>Whereupon they went into the next room together for a few minutes. Lucretia then returned and said to her sister, &quot;Sister, Lino is not an impostor. He is a clever fellow.&quot; </p>
				<p>Just what happened during those few minutes in the other room has never been told, but it was the contention of the prosecution, later on, that Lino had reminded Lucretia of the circumstances of William's death and that her fate was in his hands. This may or may not have been true.</p>
				<p>On July 17th, Lino departed again for Philadelphia to &quot;collect some money from a friend.&quot; To assist him in this he took with him all the loose money in the house, a pair of gold and silver watches, an assorted collection of breast pins, finger rings and medals, a musical box, &quot;silver bells with whistle,&quot; whatever they were, a cake basket and, indeed, whatever else he could lay his hands on. All these he took with Lucretia's consent! And, naturally, being in need of some mode of transport, he took the family horse and carriage too.</p>
				<p>He even took little Lucretia with him, but, evidently finding that she had no market value, he returned her the next day-which is more than he did with anything else. Andalusia had seen the last of Lino, but Lucretia did not know that. The events of the next week will be clearer if they are stated briefly in chronological order.</p>
				<p>On the 18th, Lino wrote from Philadelphia that he was the guest of Colonel Cuesta, that he had there received a letter saying that his friend who owed him the money was dead, and that he was going on to Baltimore. The letter ended, &quot;I Remain your invariable and constant faithful Beloved Husband.&quot;</p>
				<p>On the 20th, Lucretia responded to this effusion with one of her own which contained little other than passionate and very flowery endearments, and in which she is &quot;ready to exclaim with the poet: &quot;How unsubstantial is this earthly statel How fickle every sublunary joy: One hour exulting midst the flowers we rove; The next desponding tread on prickly thorns.'&quot; The quotation was more apt than she was able fully to appreciate.</p>
				<p>On the 19th, meanwhile, Lino had written from Balti-more, saying that his dead friend had left him $45,000. All was well! But under the same cover he wrote to say that &quot;the law would not allow him to take possession of the property,&quot; and that he was going to Washington to see the President about it. There is much eloquence:</p>
				<p>&quot;My soul pours forth showers of tears. ... I neither eat, drink or sleep for love of you. ... Give to Abian [one of the children] eight thousand three hundred kisses.&quot; [It was all very touching. This letter had been put into English for Lino by a professional translator who added a postscript of his own, saying in part,] &quot;The translator of the above cannot close his duties without expressing the hope of one day beholding a lady capable of inspiring such ardent affection.&quot;</p>
				<p>Much distressed by the anguish of soul expressed in this letter, Lucretia hurried off to Philadelphia to consult Colonel Cuesta, who might lend a hand in alleviating matters. Here, for the first time, she learned the truth. The consul assured her that Lino was an impostor, and that he had not seen him for some time.</p>
				<p>Lino, knowing nothing of this episode, continued to pour out his grief at not being able to get his $45,000, in several letters more.</p>
				<p>&quot;I am dying of grief. The very warbling of the birds is to me a sound of lament. The sun afflicts me with his rays! The moon herself and all the bright stars present to me no other idea than that of my dearest Lucretia.&quot;</p>
				<p>It was good stuff, but it came a little late in the day.</p>
				<p>On the 31st, Lucretia wrote Lino her letter of farewell. It is the only one of any real importance in the entire cor-respondence, for it was written by a woman whose eyes were, at last, fully opened, and whose very real pain was far too great to permit her to write other than sincerely.</p>
				<p>In this letter Lucretia reproaches him and pleads with him in turn. She reviews her discovery of his deception and treachery and implores him to return her some part of her property, because he has left her and the children almost destitute. &quot;By this time, I suppose, my rings decorate the fingers of one whom, perhaps, you do love sin-cerely,&quot; she writes in all her bitterness; and again, &quot;I cannot think you indulge in grief if you are in possession of the $45,000 which you wrote me you expected to receive; and then you visit the President frequently, and have the honor of walking with &amp; Duke of England. All this must surely make you happy without your sending even a wish or a thought after me.&quot; Poor foolish, deluded Lucretia! Her dream died hard. And-the worst was still ahead.</p>
				<p>It was the last few phrases of this letter that the prosecution were later to harp on as implying a &quot;guilty knowl-edge.&quot; In these, Lucretia said, &quot;I am constrained to acknowledge that I do not believe that God will permit either you or me to be happy this side of the grave.&quot; It needs no special pleading to recognize that this does imply guilty knowledge, but it seems equally clear that the guilt refers rather to the many and manifest wrongs that William suffered from Lucretia because of her insane infatuation for Lino than to actual knowledge of the murder. </p>
				<p>This letter evidently never reached Lino. In some unexplained manner it fell into other hands. If Lino had received it, he would only have sneered. Not receiving it, it was to take him to the foot of the gallows.</p>
				<p>It was nearly a month later, between August 20th and 25th, that the High Constable of Philadelphia, Willis H. Blayney, had a communication from a gentleman in Washington charging that he had been recently swindled by Lino and enclosing Lucretia's letter. Blayney took the problem to the Acting Recorder of Philadelphia, Joseph M'Ilvaine, and these two, together with a Mr. Reeside, set out for Andalusia to look into matters. The hunt was up.</p>
				<p>From his own testimony it seems certain that, before interviewing Lucretia, M'Ilvaine had taken the precaution of picking up what neighborhood gossip he could gather. As usual, there was plenty. The day was Sunday, but not everyone was in church; certainly not Mr. Boutcher, the death of whose ducks still weighed heavily upon him. So that, not only was M'Ilvaine ready to ask questions, but armed doubly with Lucretia's letter and the current suspicions of the countryside, he knew pretty well what questions to ask.</p>
				<p>In the small parlor, Lucretia faced her questioner with unconcealed apprehension. What now? She had not long to wait. M'Ilvaine told her of the complaint from Wash-ington-but not that he had her letter-that he knew Lino was an impostor, and asked whether she &quot;had suffered from his impositions.&quot; Lucretia's lips tightened as she said No. M'Ilvaine then quoted her own letter to her, and she was forced to admit what they both already knew. The recorder asked if she knew where Lino was, and again Lucretia said No-only that he had gone &quot;North.&quot; Then came out the amazing fact that she had seen and talked with him only a day or two before. The man had had the incredible audacity to stop and see her on his way from Washington; and not only to see her but even to renew, to some extent, his old spell. Indeed, Lino's influence on Lucretia seems to have been little short of hypnotic. After some circumlocution, M'Ilvaine suggested that he had &quot;a very strong impression that Mr. Chapman had died by poison, and that Lino had administered it to him.&quot; At this, Lucretia grew lividly pale, her dry tongue licked her dryer lips, and she fought for breath. As soon as she could speak, she combated the idea; told of William's affection for Lino, and of Lino's care for William during his last illness. The recorder was not impressed. M'Ilvaine queried her more closely about the circumstances of William's death, and she answered quite frankly and with no indication of guilt. She said that she had been surprised that Lino had stayed so long in Washington, but that he had explained that he had been to New Orleans and back; had gone all the way on the railroad, and had traveled night and day at thirty miles an hour. The recorder pointed out that there was no railroad to New Orleans, and Lucretia bit her lip and shrank back. M'Ilvaine finally left, feeling that there was an unpleasant mystery somewhere, and that the first thing to do was to arrest Lino. In this he had less trouble than might have been expected.</p>
				<p>It must be reiterated that M'Ilvaine did not know, as very few people knew, that Lucretia and Lino had been married. Even the interested neighbors did not know. Even Lucretia's family and relations-she was a daughter of Colonel Zenas Winslow of Brewster, Barnstable County, Cape Cod—knew only of William's sudden death and of the presence of the rich and interesting young stranger. They knew nothing of the marriage.</p>
				<p>From &quot;information received&quot;-just what information or from whom received was never brought out—M'Ilvaine concluded that Lino was either in Boston or on the Cape, and High Constable Blayney who, in spite of his title, appears to have been a very ordinary policeman, was dispatched to arrest him. Ordinary or not, Blayney &quot;got his man&quot; in the approved fashion, and proceeded at once to escort him back to Philadelphia on the boat. Lino's little fing was over.</p>
				<p>Before Lino fell into the outstretched arms of the law, however, he managed to create a small tempest of his own on the Cape, after his inimitable fashion and his own singular concept of ethics.</p>
				<p>In the brief interview he had with Lucretia on his way &quot;North,&quot; by which we are to understand Cape Cod, Lino got from her-further amazement is futile-letters of in-troduction, not only to her own family, but also to wealthy and influential friends. With these Lino, always a quick worker, proceeded to cash in. He cashed a draft on Lucretia for $1,000 and then proposed marriage to her niece. Let it not be said that New England is matter of fact and immune from romance! The lady, dazzled as her aunt had been before her, accepted the impetuous lover and consented to join him in Boston. Only the fact that Lino was arrested twenty-four hours before the marriage was to have taken place saved the Puritan maiden from the toils of the seducer.</p>
				<p>On the trip back on the boat with High Constable Blay-ney, Lino was taken with one of his &quot;spells,&quot; but this time it was a spell of sheer terror. Lino knew what awaited him. In Philadelphia he was clapped promptly into jail and charged with being a swindler. Murder was still unproven. This was during the first week in September, 1831.</p>
				<p>Lino did not struggle. He seems to have felt that the game was up. Lucretia, however, fought with a panic born of desperation to free herself from the net that, day by day, was closing around her.</p>
				<p>On September 10th, she called twice upon Recorder M'Ilvaine, accompanied by her counsel, J. H. Campbell, repeating her story over and over again, much as it has been set down here. The recorder, like many who were to follow him, did his best to believe her account, finding himself baffled by the woman's immeasurable folly. Was it possible that anyone could have been such a fool? To this very day, the question remains unanswered.</p>
				<p>A few days after this talk with Mr. M'Ilvaine, the National Gazette of Philadelphia copied a story from a New York paper linking Lucretia openly with the suspicion of her husband's death.</p>
				<p>And on the 21st day of September, William Chapman's body was exhumed from its grave in All Saints churchyard. It was singularly well preserved. The face was still black, as it had been the night the man had died, the night that Lino had shaved him.</p>
				<p>Later, the defense was to call the rector of All Saints to testify that the grave had been dug more deeply than usual, and that the quality of the soil might account for the remarkable preservation of the body. It was useless. Even at that time, one hundred years ago, when the tests for arsenic were far less accurate than they are today, it was a known fact that the presence of arsenic in a body would arrest decay. And when the post-mortem examination was made enough arsenic was still found in William's body to have killed a dozen men. He had been saturated with the poison.</p>
				<p>After that, there was no further delay. Lucretia was arrested and lodged in the jail at Erie, charged with murder. The charge against Lino was also changed to the capital offense.</p>
				<p>From her cell in Erie, Lucretia continued her fight for life. She wrote long appeals to Colonel Cuesta, the cautious consul from Mexico, and it is impossible to read her letters written during this period, as it is impossible to read the earlier ones written to Lino, without being forced to believe that this woman had been a monumental fool but that she was not a murderess. Still, though she called on the world in general and her erstwhile neighbors in particular to vindicate her, both the world and the neighbors took the entirely practical view that while, indeed, she might be innocent, she had certainly done everything possible to make herself appear guilty. And yet, she did not lack for loyal friends.</p>
				<p>The two prisoners were held to await the action of the Grand Jury, and their formal indictment took place on December 12th, almost exactly seven months from that warm evening in May when Lino had trudged up to the Chapman house in Andalusia, asking for shelter.</p>
				<p>On February 14, 1832-and how Fate must have laughed when she chose Valentine's Day!—the accused were placed on trial at the Quarter Sessions in Doylestown.</p>
				<p>At the very outset, Lucretia's counsel won a vitally important point, in that it was ruled that the two prisoners should have separate trials. Accordingly, Lino was taken back to jail, and Lucretia stood at the bar alone. The separation of Lucretia's cause from that of a man who was now a proven blackguard gave her a good fighting chance.</p>
				<p>The testimony was voluminous, and the trial lasted twelve days, in those times an unusual duration, which signified eloquently the importance and the difficulty of the case.</p>
				<p>From all the welter of words, a few material points stand out clearly.</p>
				<p>William Chapman had been poisoned with arsenic.</p>
				<p>There could be no question as to that. It remained to be discovered who had administered the poison, at what time, and in what way. Means, motive, and opportunity could be proven, directly or by implication, against both Lino and Lucretia.</p>
				<p>Lino had bought the arsenic, and, considering his relationship with Lucretia, it was at least a fair assumption that she was aware of the purchase. Lucretia had an obvious motive for doing away with her husband in her wish to marry Lino and his gold mines. Lino had an equally obvious motive in his desire to marry William's widow and possess himself of her inheritance. The question of &quot;opportunity,&quot; however, presents a much more complicated problem.</p>
				<p>All during William Chapman's last illness the house had been full of people, servants, neighbors, and children. Almost anyone could have had access to whatever food was served. The prosecution chose largely to disregard William's initial attack and concentrated their efforts on the Monday afternoon and evening of the week that William died; that Monday on which he had suddenly become worse, after having eaten the chicken and drunk a little of the broth, the remains of which had so fatal an effect on Mr. Boutcher's ducklings.</p>
				<p>On the one hand, it was Lucretia herself who had prepared both the broth and the chicken. On the other, so far as the broth was concerned, Lucretia had left it, before her small daughter took it up to her father's room, on a table that was within easy reach of anyone and everyone. If one of the children had tasted the broth, as might easily have happened, and if the broth had been poisoned, that child would have died. Would any mother have taken such a chance? What little that William had not eaten of the chicken had been thrown out of the kitchen door with the remains of the broth. The ducklings ate the refuse-and died. Was it, then, the chicken alone that was poisoned? It was impossible to say.</p>
				<p>For either Lucretia or Lino to account for every moment of their time and for every detail of their movements about the house—as would have been so simple for them to do in most detective stories-was out of the question. There was far too much going and coming. Lucretia might have done the deed—yes—but so might Lino.</p>
				<p>Whose was the hand?</p>
				<p>Methods of criminal investigation were by no means as thorough or as exact in those days as they are today; and, moreover, by the time that any investigation was made, in this instance, the trail was cold.</p>
				<p>The case finally went to the jury at nine in the evening of February 26th. At eleven o'clock the ringing of the court bell announced that a verdict had been reached.</p>
				<p>Lucretia Chapman had been found-Not Guilty.</p>
				<p>It was on a Wednesday morning in the following April, the 25th, that Lino came up for trial before the same court in Doylestown, but before that happened something took place that must be recorded in its proper order.</p>
				<p>On the 9th of April Lino wrote a letter from the jail in Philadelphia to &quot;Inspector&quot; Phipps of the city police. This letter, which did not refer to the murder by so much as one word, a significant omission, did tell who Lino was and what his career had been up to the evening of May 9th of the year before. As Lino's statement is very probably an adroit mixture of fact and fiction, it is quite impossible, at this late date, to disentangle the two. At any rate, as the letter was, very properly, not made public until after his trial, it had no effect on the verdict of the jury. Here, in large part, is what Lino has to say about himself:</p>
				<p>&quot;On the 6th of July, 1829, I sailed [from Cuba] with the expedition against Mexico, commanded by General Bar-radas, from the Havana. On the and of August we arrived and effected a landing within 6o miles to the south of Tampico. On the 5th of August the Spanish army took possession of Tampico. About two weeks after we had taken possession of that city, I was sent out to a little town called Altamira, to watch the motions of the Mexican army, commanded by General Antonia Lopes Santa Ana, and whilst in this little town I was arrested as a spy from the Spanish army, and on suspicion of being a Cadet in the service of the King of Spain. I was sent prisoner immediately by the Mexicans to Vera Cruz. In the mean time, General Barradas, and the army under his command, capitulated, and they were sent to New Orleans, to be sent home to the Island of Cuba. I was sent up to the city of Mexico, to be united with the other troops, but the army being sent from Tampico, I did not join them, but was sent to Vera Cruz, and came from there to New York to find a passage to the Island of Cuba, where my father lives and where my home is. You will observe that I was taken as a spy, and that I was pardoned only on account of my youth. When I arrived at New York, having lost my documents and certificates, the Spanish Consul would not assist me, and being utterly destitute and in great distress, I came on to this city [Philadelphia] in search of a countryman of mine who, could I have found him, would have relieved me. After I came here, a captain of a vessel bound to the Havana, told me he would give me a passage home, as soon as he could take in a cargo. In the mean time I was arrested in this city for stealing a common breast pin, a very common silver watch and a musical box. These things were given to me by another person of my own age, and what ought to convince others that I did not steal them, is the fact that I gave them to another boy as a gift. As, however, the witness swore that the articles were not given to me, and I being unable to prove it, and ignorant of the laws, the customs and the language of this country, I was convicted, and received a sentence of eighteen months. They said in Court that the watch was worth twenty dollars, when the value of it was not more than two dollars.&quot;</p>
				<p>And then the prize line:</p>
				<p>&quot;Being sensible that the Americans are very favorable to the Spanish nation generally, and that Inspectors are very humane men, I am induced to apply for a pardon in order that I may return home to my parents.&quot;</p>
				<p>Whatever may be said of most of this remarkable docu-ment, one statement at least is true. Lino was indeed confined in the Philadelphia jail for theft, though he did not serve his full term of eighteen months, and was released on the morning of May 9th, the evening of the same day finding him at the Chapman door.</p>
				<p>Lino's trial was a brief affair, most of the testimony already having been aired during Lucretia's ordeal. It began on a Wednesday morning, and at nine o'clock on Friday evening the jury retired to consider their verdict. In &quot;somewhat less than three hours&quot; they came back with-Guilty of Murder in the First Degree.</p>
				<p>Being asked whether he had anything to say before sentence was passed, Lino volunteered the following:</p>
				<p>&quot;Before the court shall proceed to pass upon me the sentence of the law, I wish to say a few words to them. My name is Carolino. I was born on the 20th of December, 1809, in the city of Trinidad, in the island of Cuba, where my parents now reside. I was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church and desire to die in its faith. I pray that a priest of that religion may be sent me that I may prepare myself for death, by confession, and the blessed abso-lution, and by partaking of the holy communion according to the rites and ceremonies of that church.</p>
				<p>&quot;I have written to my father and brother, and expect they will come to this country to see me, and I have in the island of Cuba a daughter four years old. It is necessary before I die that I should execute some legal papers, in order to secure some property to my daughter. I therefore pray the court to grant me at least a few months of existence before I am ordered to be executed.&quot;</p>
				<p>Beyond the fact that this differs from his statement to the &quot;Inspector,&quot; to which he signed himself, &quot;Celestino Almentero,&quot; this tells us little, except that Lino was twenty-two years old—Lucretia was past forty-and that he had been married before.</p>
				<p>The presiding justice replied in few words:</p>
				<p>&quot;These matters will be laid before the governor, who will, no doubt, grant the request which you make.</p>
				<p>&quot;Lino Amalia Espos y Mina, the sentence which the law imposes upon you is, that you be taken hence to the prison of Bucks County, from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution; and that you there be hanged by the neck until you are dead-dead—dead. And may God have mercy on your soul!&quot;</p>
				<p>God's justice is more sure than man's.</p>
				<p>The governor pardoned Lino.</p>
				<p>Lucretia disappeared to hide her shame where she could.</p>
				<p>The records do not say. It may be that in Andalusia or in Brewster, Barnstable County, Cape Cod, her descendants live today. Her further history is, as she would have it, empty.</p>

				<head type="chapter">THE VEILED MURDERESS</head>
				<p>IN THE YEAR 1853, there was on River Street, at the north end of Troy, New York, a small white cottage, close by the left bank of the Hudson River. The cottage had a neatly pillared front and between that and the street there was a small expanse of grass and shrubs. Taller buildings masked the cottage and gave it rather the appearance of having shrunk back from the sidewalk, as though it modestly desired to escape observation as, perhaps, it did. From the rear of the house one looked westward over the Hudson to Green Island. Altogether, it was a very pleas ant retreat, and a retreat is what it was.</p>
				<p>The white cottage was inhabited by a mysterious lady.</p>
				<p>The lady called herself Henrietta Robinson, which was not her name. She was young, about twenty-six years old, and was possessed of that winning loveliness that is so much more appealing than mere beauty. Blue-black hair, dark blue eyes, a fair skin, and an exquisitely moulded figure combined with a natural grace and dignity to complete a very charming picture.</p>
				<p>Nor was she alone in the cottage. A young servant girl did the work indoors, and there was an old, white-headed man who acted as gardener. There were few callers, but sometimes, after darkness had fallen, a gentleman, his face well muffled, slipped through the garden gate and into the house, only to leave again before sunrise.</p>
				<p>On a day in the second week of May, 1853, Henrietta Robinson might have been seen standing in that room of the cottage which looked out over the river. She was gazing down meditatively at a small paper packet that she held in her hand. The packet contained a quantity of a white, crystalline powder. Coming to a sudden determina-tion, Mrs. Robinson bent down and pulled loose a corner of the carpet from the tacks that held it. Then, having slipped the packet snugly underneath, she stamped the tacks back firmly into place.</p>
				<p>The contents of that packet were to take two lives.</p>
				<p>Henrietta Robinson had appeared in Troy about four years before, during the late autumn or winter of 1849. Even before she moved to the white cottage she had lived in seclusion, as befitted a &quot;kept woman,&quot; for that is what Mrs. Robinson was. The name of her lover—or lovers, if she had more than one-has been so successfully concealed that one is led to the inevitable conclusion that he was sufficiently high in the Trojan scale to be worth concealing. It does not matter. He or they figure in this story only us pieces of &quot;property&quot; may be said to figure in a play. The only lover who was of real emotional importance in Henrietta's life had been parted from her years before, when she was barely eighteen. That had been in Troy, too, when Henrietta Robinson, under another name, had attended the Troy Female Seminary, that famous and select establishment for the instruction of young ladies of good family. Henrietta's family was very good indeed. And now, here she was, back in Troy, hidden from old friends in the cottage by the river.</p>
				<p>In spite of her seclusion, Henrietta Robinson was conspicuous figure in north Troy, not because she was beautiful, not because she was mysterious, not even because she was &quot;kept.&quot; The truth is that Henrietta was mad. But the neighbors did not know that. They thought her merely eccentric and &quot;queer.&quot;</p>
				<p>Whether this madness was in Henrietta's blood from the beginning, or whether her mind broke under the continual strain of a proud nature in conflict with misfortune, it is difficult to say. That it is at all possible even to sketch her true history is certainly not due to her, for she fought with all her weapons to keep it secret; nor is it due to her family, for they denied her to the very end. But one slip leads to another and, as Mr. Shakespeare has said, it is dangerous to &quot;protest too much,&quot; so that, what with one thing and another, it is not impossible to trace Henrietta's strange and tragic career.</p>
				<p>At the time this story opens, and for many years before, there lived in the city of Quebec, Canada, a Mr. Robert Wood, a man who had both social position and the money with which to display it. Mr. Wood had one son and four daughters, and a man with four daughters has one prime obligation to the community, to the daughters, and to himself, and that is to marry them off just as well and as soon as he can.</p>
				<p>Whether because of his money or because of the natural attractions of the girls, Mr. Wood managed to do very well for himself—and for them. The oldest, Georgianna, married the eldest son of Sir William Clayton and went to live in England. The second, Emma, married a surgeon of the Royal Artillery, a Dr. McIntosh, and disappeared into Scotland. The youngest, Harriet, profiting by this ex-ample, also adopted a military career in the person of Captain Mackay, likewise of the Royal Artillery, and departed with him for Dublin. So that if Charlotte, the third daughter, had only espoused the Welsh Fusiliers, the pretty quartette would have boxed the British Isles between them. But she didn't.</p>
				<p>Charlotte Wood became Henrietta Robinson.</p>
				<p>Let us see how this metamorphosis took place.</p>
				<p>Charlotte Wood was born in 1827. In 1843, when she was sixteen, she was packed off to the Female Seminary at Troy, where her sisters had been before her. Up to that time she was probably as spoiled as any one of five children belonging to a rich and respectable family could be. Which is to say that the indulgence of her parents stopped short only at the point at which they themselves might be inconvenienced.</p>
				<p>Charlotte stayed for nearly two years at the seminary in Troy, and during that time she seems to have done little to excite remark. She gave a party for a doll, which seems a little odd today considering that she was over sixteen. She was saved from drowning, but the only wonder is that, wearing the bathing suits they did, more &quot;females&quot; of the period did not drown. And she responded with sufficient enthusiasm to a religious &quot;revival&quot; in Ferry Street to make her remembered locally. But these are trivial. One thing, and that of real importance, she did do. She fell in love. And she was loved in return.</p>
				<p>The gentleman who painstakingly compiled the original account of this curious history, Mr. D. Wilson, for all his quaint and mid-Victorian turns of phrase, has set down the record so clearly that it is well worth giving in his own words. Says he:</p>
				<p>&quot;Among the acquaintances she had formed during her residence at the seminary was a young gentleman of the city, who, from the hour of their introduction, possessed her favorable regard. He was a young man of fine personal bearing and appearance, amiable in his deportment, frank and intelligent. A mutual attachment sprang up between them, and with her temperament and mental organiza-tion, it will be readily conceived, the full torrent of her affections was permitted to flow without restraint toward the object of her idolatry.</p>
				<p>&quot;Doubts have been expressed, after an examination of her phrenological developments, whether, under any cir-cumstances, she could have held to the strict decorums of life. We are constrained to believe that, if her first and only love had been suffered to result in the consummation of marriage, her education, the innate pride and dignity of her character, and her connection with one to whom she was so ardently attached, would have proved sufficient to have restrained her within the bounds of virtue; at least, we are confident she would have avoided the disastrous destiny which has overtaken her.&quot;</p>
				<p>In 1855, when D. Wilson made his report, it was phrenology. In 1934, when this is written, it is psycho-analysis. It is curious how the two agree.</p>
				<p>Whoever this early lover was—his name is hidden—his rank did not measure up to the standard of a father who had married one daughter to the eldest son of a baronet, and the other two into the Royal Artillery. Charlotte was snatched back from the Female Seminary to the parental roof tree in Quebec.</p>
				<p>Letters followed-it is a pity that they are lost to us— between the young lovers, but as D. Wilson remarks succinctly, &quot;events were at hand, destined not only to terminate their epistolary intercourse, but to crush forever the last hope of a matrimonial union.&quot; Well-life is sometimes like that; or it was, in 1846.</p>
				<p>Melodrama is only absurd because it is so true to life that we cannot endure it without laughing. The story of the maiden who is torn from the arms of her poor-but-honest lover and thrust into those of his socially and financially successful rival is very trite-and true.</p>
				<p>Quebec was the headquarters station of more than one British regiment doing its term of duty overseas, and among these the 93rd Highlanders ranked well. Young Lieutenant William F. A. Elliot, eldest son of Sir Francis Elliot, placed his hand and heart at the disposal of the unhappy nineteen-year-old Charlotte Maria Wood, and was —after who knows what floods of tears and pleadings— accepted by that lady.</p>
				<p>So they were married, these two, on the 16th of Decem-ber, 1846.</p>
				<p>Romance dies, and like the fabulous Phoenix rises reborn from its own ashes. But sometimes it is dreadful in its new form.</p>
				<p>Certainly, from a worldly standpoint, Charlotte had made a good match, and Mr. Robert Wood was to be congratulated on his son-in-law. The only trouble was that Charlotte was not in love with her husband. There is nothing to indicate that, in what follows, Elliot was in any way to blame. His small part in this story, and in Charlotte's life, is hardly as well defined as a noontide shadow. One pictures him, entirely by inference and quite probably incorrectly, as a bluff young Briton, as kindly and as affectionate as any bulldog, and with about the same perceptive sensibilities. Within his own limitations— he functioned.</p>
				<p>Charlotte had two children in the next two years.</p>
				<p>Before these interesting biological events took place, however, there were other happenings of even greater significance.</p>
				<p>It seems probable that Elliot resigned his commission immediately on his marriage. Certain it is that a few days after the wedding the young couple left Quebec for New York, on their way to England. Apart from his natural desire to take his bride home, introduce her to his family, and to take up the position in England to which his birth and recently acquired status as a married man entitled him, there was doubtless a hope in Elliot's mind that a new life, new scenes, and new distractions would gradually obliterate Charlotte's memory of her old lover and her shattered romance. The hope was as amiable as it was futile.</p>
				<p>It could only have been a malign fate that suggested to the young husband that they break their journey by stopping over a day or two at Troy. Or it may have been Charlotte's insistence or Elliot's idea of giving pleasure to his bride. Whatever it was, it was fatal, for from the beginning to the end of her career the city of Troy was destined to be as baleful an influence in Charlotte Wood's life as the plain of Philippi was in that of Brutus. On this occasion, her honeymoon, Charlotte no sooner got to Troy than she went to pieces. Here were the first signs of madness.</p>
				<p>She put on men's clothes and wandered through the city, apparently aimlessly. There may, however, have been method in her madness. Was she revisiting old haunts— searching for someone? Did she find him, and was her interview the breaking point? No one knows. She certainly found no relief in her masquerade, for these perambulations were succeeded by hysterical outbursts in which she raved over her lost hopes and reproached her husband bitterly. Also, on the testimony of that gentleman, she tried to find oblivion in the bottle. She was just nineteen.</p>
				<p>The honeymoon was not a success, and the Elliots sailed from New York with a problem on their hands.</p>
				<p>Life in conventional, mid-Victorian London offered no solution. Charlotte rebelled tempestuously, violently, and at every point against the multitude of restrictions that hedged her. Details are lacking, but we are told on good authority that &quot;her domestic life, during her entire residence in Europe, was so violent as to be the source of perpetual annoyance and mortification to her friends.&quot; Elliot had a tiger by the tail and didn't know what to do about it. Charlotte could find no outlet, no relief. She was balked at every turn.</p>
				<p>Elliot took her to Scotland, to France, and to Italy, in the perfectly vain hope that she would forget. It was like offering a lollipop to a starving woman. Charlotte grew to detest her husband and then to hate him. He hoped that their two children might heal the breach. She only included them in the bitterness of her revulsion. The end, when it came, was swift and characteristic.</p>
				<p>In the autumn of 1849, when Charlotte was twenty-two, she walked out of the Elliot house in London and took ship for America, accompanied only by her French maid, Helen Reynaud.</p>
				<p>Arriving in New York, Charlotte went to the Irving House. Both she and Reynaud had been wretchedly seasick on the voyage over and needed a few days' rest.</p>
				<p>At the Irving, she was noticed by, though she did not meet, a man who is described as one who &quot;occupied a prominent position in the world, and whose name is not unfamiliar to the people of New York.&quot; Whoever this gentleman was, he certainly had enough influence to keep his name out of print, and so it remains today, in spite of the part he played in what followed.</p>
				<p>In a day or two, Charlotte and her maid, who was shortly to drop out of the picture at some undetermined point, took the boat up the Hudson to Albany, and after three years Charlotte was back again in Troy. Again she wandered through the familiar old streets, without disguise this time, and then, finding the memories that wandered with her too painful to endure, she went on, up Lake Champlain, to Quebec. Charlotte Wood was going home.</p>
				<p>It was dusk of a fine, brisk day in autumn when Charlotte arrived in Quebec. This city had memories, too, but these were easier to bear. For three years she had been miserably unhappy, but now she was going home.</p>
				<p>She forgot that there were faster ships than the one she had crossed on, and that it is the fastest ships that carry the mail. The indignant Elliots, in London, had seen to it that Mr. Robert Wood, in Quebec, should have their version of the story well in advance.</p>
				<p>Her family were expecting her. Her father himself opened the door of the house. Charlotte entered the hall. That was as far as she got.</p>
				<p>Her greeting was met by reproaches. She had abandoned her husband and her children, and she herself was an abandoned woman. In vain she pleaded that she had been forced into a loveless marriage, and that, come what might, she could never go back. At this, reproaches gave place to taunts, and taunts to sheer abuse. Charlotte retaliated in kind, and the interview lapsed into a tirade of mutual vituperation. Charlotte was denounced and disowned, utterly and forever, and, finally, literally driven from the house and the door slammed after her. A Roman father had worked his Roman will. The only trouble was that he had not a Roman daughter to deal with.</p>
				<p>That night of her home-coming, Charlotte slept in a Quebec hotel.</p>
				<p>Charlotte had very little money left, and no one to turn to for help. Some women would have collapsed under the blow. Not Charlotte. Her mind might break, but her spirit—never. Suddenly, as she tossed on her hotel bed during the long hours of that night, it occurred to her how she might both earn a living and humiliate the father and brother who had driven her from home. She would go to her old school, the Troy Female Seminary, and apply for a position as tutoress. That would make her aristocratic relatives wince! Indeed, in speaking of it later, she said, &quot;I thought how it would sting my brother!&quot;</p>
				<p>Revenge and self-punishment all in one.</p>
				<p>The next day Charlotte took the boat that ran from Quebec, up the St. Lawrence, to Montreal and into Lake Champlain on her way back to Troy. She was moving with deadly accuracy along the line that destiny had marked for her to follow.</p>
				<p>On the boat, Charlotte noticed a man who seemed to watch her more attentively than even her beauty and her evident distress explained. Instantly, her mind was at work, and the first traces of that persecution mania that was to beset her so savagely became apparent. Was he a spy? Had her father and brother set him to follow her? Or was he a man of her husband's? She thought that she had seen him before, but she could not remember where. As a matter of fact, it was the nameless gentleman of the Irving House, but Charlotte did not know that then.</p>
				<p>There was some small difficulty when they disembarked because of the pile of luggage that Charlotte and her maid had between them, and the gentleman took advantage of the opportunity to offer his services with the Customs. The offer was accepted. Now she would find out who he was and why he was watching and spying.</p>
				<p>Instead of going direct to the seminary that night, Charlotte went to a hotel. She stayed at the hotel for a week, and when she had left it she had consented to become the mistress of the man who had followed.</p>
				<p>Revenge and self-punishment. She did not love him. She had never loved but once. But if it would sting her brother and humiliate her father to see her a paid tutoress, how much more would it sting and humiliate them to know her the &quot;kept woman&quot; of a man who was already married. She would show them! And she did.</p>
				<p>Charlotte Wood, or Mrs. Elliot, or, as she soon called herself, Henrietta Robinson, taking the name from a famous one-time mistress of King George III, was, at this time, twenty-three years old, beautiful, and cultivated. These attributes she deliberately dragged in the gutter, the better to feed her bitterness. The price was overhigh, as she soon discovered.</p>
				<p>The entire situation was gallingly impossible. For a woman whose chief characteristics were a flaming high spirit and a burning pride, it was unendurable. Something had to give way. The jam had to break.</p>
				<p>Charlotte was hardly a free agent. The Greeks did, in-deed, have a word for it. They called it Erinyes-the Fur-ies. The Hebrews knew it as demoniacal possession. To-day, it might be termed paranoia. Call it what one will, all the ages have known and feared it.</p>
				<p>There were plenty of people in Troy who might have recognized &quot;Henrietta Robinson,&quot; and because of the scandal that would have resulted from recognition, she was obliged to immure herself as closely as any cloistered nun-in spite of the very un-nunlike life she was leading. Henrietta, for we may as well call her that from now on, hugged her grief and hate, fostering and nourishing them in secret. It was no part of her plan to put herself at the mercy of the social wolf pack, for she well knew what mercy they would show.</p>
				<p>This continued for a year, and then, unable to stand the forced seclusion any longer, Henrietta moved to the nearby city of Albany, where she was not known and so might have greater freedom. But it was only her madness that was freed. It was only the Furies who were liberated.</p>
				<p>Henrietta's belief that she was being persecuted, that everyone was involved in a gigantic conspiracy against her, now became an absolute obsession. She went unnoticed; yet she was convinced that every tongue in the neighborhood was wagging. As the center of this mythical hotbed of gossip she selected a servant girl who worked in the vicinity, but what reason, if any, she had for the selection no one ever knew. It did not matter. Henrietta got herself a pistol and went out on the warpath.</p>
				<p>The persecution mania was developing homicidal tendencies. The Furies would give her no peace.</p>
				<p>There was nothing in the least secret about Henrietta's declaration of war or her preparations for battle, and so the panic-stricken serving maid promptly swore out a warrant for her arrest. She was found by the police officer &quot;in the company of a friend who, having snatched a moment's relaxation from the cares of business, was quietly seated by her side at table, enjoying his evening meal.&quot; Was this friend the old lover, a new lover, or were there many lovers by this time? There is no testimony.</p>
				<p>Charlotte Wood had become Henrietta Robinson indeed.</p>
				<p>At all events, the &quot;friend&quot; went on her bail for her good behavior, and nothing more was heard of the matter—so far as the law was concerned.</p>
				<p>But if the neighbors did not talk before this happened, they made up for their silence afterwards. They had something to talk about now. Henrietta moved to another part of the city. It was useless. The talk followed. Albany was a gossipy town in those days, and the young-woman-with-a-pistol was much too choice a morsel to give up. The fact that she was young, good-looking, well dressed, and well bred simply made it a better story—as it would today. Henrietta capitulated and went back to Troy. The Furies went with her.</p>
				<p>Now it was that she took the cottage in north Troy; the small, white cottage on the left bank of the Hudson River, in which we find her as this story opens.</p>
				<p>This was in 1852.</p>
				<p>Charlotte Wood was twenty-five years old.</p>
				<p>Henrietta Robinson was-older.</p>
				<p>The Furies were about to claim their own. As the months passed and 1852 merged into 1853, Henrietta's dementia grew in scope and in intensity. The history of the Albany servant girl was repeated over and over again, except that instead of servant girls Henrietta now selected well known citizens and respectable householders.</p>
				<p>Early in 1853, Henrietta's sanity made a final effort to reëstablish itself.</p>
				<p>Henrietta Robinson suddenly resolved to quit the life she had been leading, to go back to England, and to throw herself on her husband's mercy. That she did not do so probably only spared her another disappointment.</p>
				<p>Making her plans in secret, Henrietta fed to Boston and put up at the Revere House, intending to take the first ship for England. No sooner had she left Troy than her lover, whoever he was, missed her, and after inquiring at the docks and railroad station traced her without very much difficulty. He followed; and after a long interview at the Revere House, persuaded her to return to the white cottage on the left bank of the Hudson. Sanity had lost its throw.</p>
				<p>From this time on, Henrietta lived in a world of shadows. She shattered herself against the wall of delusion that enclosed her. There was no escape.</p>
				<p>Henrietta gave up her solitude and walked the streets of Troy, sometimes leaning on the arm of her gray-haired manservant and sometimes alone. She stopped casual passers-by to tell them how her neighbors were conspiring against her. She armed herself with pistols and openly threatened the murder of those who she insisted were bent on her ruin. Her neighbors, according to her, were a band of burglars who were going to pillage her house. She insisted that a man who lived near her had stopped navigation in the Hudson and demanded that the authorities do something about it. Armed with her pistol, she roamed the city at night, and one very early morning went on her wanderings wearing only her nightdress. She boasted of a magic cork which she could hold between her teeth and which would float her safely across the Hudson.</p>
				<p>These mental lapses, while they grew in frequency and intensity, were succeeded by periods during which Henrietta seemed to be perfectly rational. Most of the time she appeared to be quiet, well bred, and well behaved, apparently quite normal. And then, a word or a look would throw her off balance, and she would become rav-ingly insane.</p>
				<p>The list of her aberrations is far too long to give in detail here, nor is it at all necessary. It is enough to say that, by this time, Henrietta was as mad as the proverbial Hatter. On one point, however, she was perfectly constant: Never by word or sign did she ever betray her true name and history. &quot;Henrietta Robinson&quot; was to mask her until the end.</p>
				<p>Sometime between the 10th and the 15th of May, 1853, Mrs. Robinson went into the drug store kept by William H. Ostrom, on the corner of River and Federal streets, and asked for some arsenic to kill rats. Mr. Ostrom sold her two ounces. Henrietta took the arsenic home and hid it under the carpet.</p>
				<p>Almost opposite the white cottage, on the corner of Rensselaer and River streets, there was a small grocery store kept by an Irishman named Timothy Lanagan. Lanagan's house consisted of only two rooms, in one of which was the store and in the other of which lived Lana-gan, his wife, and four children. That was the measure of the business.</p>
				<p>Lanagan helped out the grocery trade by selling liquor on the side, and every now and again he would give dance in the grocery, which was well attended by whatever Irish could squeeze their way in. It was a typical Trish crossroads enterprise, transplanted to Troy.</p>
				<p>Henrietta bought her groceries from Lanagan, and during the spring of '53, he noticed that her orders for beer and brandy increased measurably.</p>
				<p>It was at this time too that Catherine Lubee, Lanagan's sister-in-law, a girl of twenty-five who had been in domestic service in Albany, but who was now out of a job, came to make the seventh occupant of the room adjoining the grocery store. She seemed a simple, rather attractive, and wholly inoffensive girl.</p>
				<p>About the middle of May, Lanagan gave one of his dances in the grocery, and this time Henrietta Robinson was one of the guests. It was a long step down, even for Henrietta. For Charlotte Wood it was about the final circle in hell. During the evening Henrietta complained that one of the men there had insulted her. Perhaps he had, but probably it was only a part of her general de-lusion. In any event, she made such a to-do over the alleged insult that the Lanagans asked her to leave. And, after distributing a few insults on her own account, she did so. The entire incident is unimportant, except for the fact that it was to be cited later as a reason for Henrietta's animus against the Lanagan household.</p>
				<p>Early on the morning of May 25th, Henrietta crossed the street to Lanagans' and bought a quart of beer. About two hours later, she sent her gray-headed gardener over to borrow two dollars of Lanagan, a sum for which she had no possible need. No sooner had the gardener reached the store, however, than Henrietta was at his heels, demanding to know why he was so long about it. The Lanagans didn't want to lend the two dollars and so said simply that they didn't have it. Henrietta went home, but at eleven o'clock she was back again, this time with a wild tale, that she had told many times before, that her husband had been in a railway accident. She went through the store into the back room, where there were several loungers, and totally forgetting the story of her injured husband became involved in an argument that led finally to her being conducted to the door.</p>
				<p>In 1849 Charlotte Wood was a person of consideration in London society. Four years later, in 1853, she was being put out of the back room of a wayside saloon. The descent into hell had not been easy, but it had been sure.</p>
				<p>At one o'clock Henrietta was back at the Lanagans' again. This time she found the family in the back room sitting down to their midday meal. There was an egg on the table, and Henrietta pointed to it, saying:</p>
				<p>&quot;Whose egg is that?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Yours, if you want it,&quot; replied Lanagan, and then, having finished his own meal, got up and went out into the store, leaving Henrietta, Mrs. Lanagan, and Catherine at the table. The Lanagan children were, evidently, not there. They had probably been fed earlier and sent out of doors.</p>
				<p>Henrietta sat down at the table, and Mrs. Lanagan peeled a potato for her, which she ate with her egg. This simple repast being disposed of, Henrietta invited Mrs. Lanagan and Catherine to join her in a glass of beer. They both refused. Paying no attention to this, Henrietta asked for some sugar, and when Mrs. Lanagan reminded her that she couldn't want any sugar as she had bought nine pounds during the week, she replied that she wanted a little powdered sugar to put in the beer—a decoction the essential vileness of which has not prevented its being considered a delicacy even up to the present day. So Mrs. Lanagan went into the other room and brought back the powdered sugar in a saucer. Then she went back, brought in some beer in a quart measure, and poured out two glasses. While she was doing this, Henrietta walked up and down the room, holding the saucer of sugar in her hand. There was not enough beer in the measure to fill the glasses, and, as Henrietta insisted that they be full to the brim, the good-natured Mrs. Lanagan went back for more. When she returned this time, Henrietta was pouring the sugar into the two tumblers. Mrs. Lanagan filled up the glasses and sat down at the table to drink her beer, apparently repenting her initial refusal. But as she lifted her glass she noticed what seemed to be a film of powder on the surface of the beer and took up a spoon to skim it off, thinking that it was the remains of the sugar. Henrietta quickly caught her arm and took the spoon away, saying, &quot;Don't you do so. That is the best of it.&quot; Just at that moment, Lanagan called to his wife from the store, and she left the room, her beer still untasted on the table.</p>
				<p>That saved her life.</p>
				<p>Lanagan, intending to leave his wife to mind the store while he went out on an errand, came into the back room and, seeing the glass of untasted beer, took it up and drank it.</p>
				<p>That cost him his life.</p>
				<p>Catherine Lubee drank up her beer too.</p>
				<p>Hers was the second death.</p>
				<p>Henrietta Robinson had gone home, her beer untouched.</p>
				<p>That was a little after one o'clock. Just before three, Henrietta returned and found Catherine lying on the bed in the back room, very ill. Henrietta asked her how she felt, and the dying girl replied that she was very poorly indeed; and accused Henrietta of putting something in the beer that sickened her. Henrietta answered that she had put nothing in the beer but what would do her good. Then she called for more beer for herself, which was refused. It is a grim little scene.</p>
				<p>At this point Timothy Lanagan staggered into the room and collapsed on the sofa. Gasping with pain and nausea, he begged:</p>
				<p>&quot;Run for the doctor. I am done!&quot; </p>
				<p>Mrs. Lanagan turned fiercely on Henrietta, who was standing near, looking on.</p>
				<p>&quot;What have you done?&quot; she cried. &quot;You have killed the father of my children!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;No!&quot; said Henrietta. &quot;No—I have done no such thing!&quot;</p>
				<p>Henrietta then attempted to go over to Lanagan, but the wife pushed her away, and Lanagan himself threw up his hands to ward her off, crying out:</p>
				<p>&quot;Go, woman! Go!&quot;</p>
				<p>Hennetta went.</p>
				<p>Lanagan died at a quarter to seven that evening, and Catherine Lubee at five the next morning.</p>
				<p>The Furies had done their work well.</p>
				<p>At about six o'clock on that evening of May 25th, about forty-five minutes before Timothy Lanagan died, Henrietta Robinson appeared in Ostrom's drug store, where she had purchased arsenic not very long before.</p>
				<p>Ostrom testified that she was &quot;very much excited,&quot; and that she said that she was charged with poisoning several people, Lanagan being one of them. Two points stand out clearly: first, that she could not have been aware at this time that any charge had been made against her; and, second, that there were more people than the Lanagans in her mind as possible victims.</p>
				<p>Henrietta went on to tell Ostrom that these accusations were made against her because she had refused to lend the Lanagans one hundred dollars. She asked Ostrom what she should do. He advised her to go to the chief of police. Whereupon, Henrietta jerked a revolver from her breast and remarked that she was quite capable of defending her-self. Mr. Ostrom, being both cautious and practical, an admirable combination when dealing with a homicidal maniac, took the revolver from her and probed the barrel with the handle of his penholder. The chamber was loaded, and Ostrom observed that there were three or four percussion caps on the hammer. He noticed further, however, that the lock was so rusty that it was doubtful whether the gun could be fired. (This revolver was, evidently, one of those which had a number of barrels which revolved against a firing pin, in distinction to those of today, which are only made possible by the invention of the metallic cartridge, in which a magazine cylinder revolves between a single barrel and the hammer.) Ostrom, reassured, gave the revolver back to Henrietta, and she left the store, presumably to seek police protection. She had gone only a short distance down the street before she found it—or it found her.</p>
				<p>Henrietta was arrested shortly before seven o'clock that evening by police officer Charles Burns, &quot;at a cabinet-shop, next door to Clark's drug store, near by the Mansion House.&quot; She walked to the jail with him quite calmly, laughing and joking along the way. Burns did not tell her with what she was charged.</p>
				<p>That same evening, Burns, along with the coroner, Dr. Bontecou, and several other persons, searched the white cottage by the Hudson. They had taken the keys from Henrietta by force.</p>
				<p>The search of the cottage revealed the packet of arsenic, hidden under the carpet, but nothing else of any signifi-cance. Henrietta's battery had been taken from her at the jail.</p>
				<p>That same night, too, the inquest was held over Lana-gan. Forty grains of arsenic were found in his intestines. The Lanagan house was examined. There was no arsenic in the sugar, and none in the barreled beer. The packet of arsenic, with sixty grains still in it, that was found under the carpet in the back parlor of the white cottage, tacked firmly down between the bed and the south wall, was the only arsenic that could be connected with the case.</p>
				<p>With Henrietta Robinson in jail, charged with a double murder, two contingencies arose, either one of which bade fair to outdo the actual crime in public interest.</p>
				<p>One was the question as to whether or not Henrietta was really insane. The other was the query that was soon blazoned across the pages of the newspapers, and which provided the material for a heated controversy throughout eastern Canada and the States for months to come, namely:</p>
				<p>&quot;Who is Henrietta Robinson?&quot;</p>
				<p>So far as Henrietta's mental condition was concerned, she was now, for the first time, confined and under expert observation.</p>
				<p>So far as her identity was concerned, she was now, equally, for the first time, as publicly exposed as though she had been set on a platform in the market place.</p>
				<p>Surely the concentrated light of publicity now thrown upon her must lay bare the truth.</p>
				<p>It didn't.</p>
				<p>From the very outset Henrietta's mental disorder displayed itself in a hundred ways. Her cell was peopled with her enemies: a mob had broken into the jail during the night to attack her; the inmates of the adjoining cells had threatened to put her into a cauldron of boiling water. And in the very midst of her recital of these nightmares she would break off to laugh meaninglessly and to complain that she was shabbily dressed. It was not, could not have been acting. The woman was indisputably insane.</p>
				<p>Parenthetically, it is interesting that her nameless lover, who had kept her in the white cottage by the river for so long, neither revealed himself nor lifted a hand to help her -now or at any other time. He evidently considered that he had returned full value for what he had received.</p>
				<p>All through June, the whisperers of Troy were busy with-Who is Henrietta Robinson?— and even as early as this the tea-table gossips had identified her, to their own satisfaction at least, with &quot;one of the Wood girls of Quebec who used to go to the seminary.&quot; But they were not sure, and the question which of the four Wood girls she was remained unanswered.</p>
				<p>The seminary promptly and bitterly denied the rumor, and an anonymous &quot;card&quot; appeared in the Troy Daily Whig of June 9th, which repeated the story all over again and then denied it more emphatically than ever. This card ended with the statement:</p>
				<p>&quot;Of the four beautiful and amiable daughters of the late Mr. Wood, who were pupils of the Troy Female Seminary, every one is married, and are now living in Great Britain, and are all allied to eminent families. Their brother, Mr. Wood, is now in Troy, having come to sift this injurious report.&quot;</p>
				<p>W. F. Wood, the brother, evidently thought the matter worth looking into, which he would hardly have done had he known positively that his four sisters were actually all in Great Britain. He visited Henrietta in prison, stayed more than an hour, and then came out, very pale and shaky, denying more vehemently than ever that Henrietta Robinson was Charlotte Wood.</p>
				<p>Her lover, her old school, and her only brother had all denied her now.</p>
				<p>From this time on Henrietta covered her face with a heavy veil.</p>
				<p>During the long summer, Henrietta's dementia gave way to melancholia, and this reached its climax in her attempted suicide.</p>
				<p>She was found violently ill in her cell one afternoon, and tests showed that she had taken vitriol. Either she had taken too much or too little, for the doctor got there in time to save her life.</p>
				<p>How did Henrietta get vitriol in prison? Certainly there was someone, brother, lover, or another, who agreed with her that it was best for her to die; someone who was anxious that the publicity of a trial should be avoided. But— the attempt failed.</p>
				<p>Henrietta was not arraigned for trial until the fall term of court, on October 10, 1853. Her counsel then asked for further postponement on the ground that her mental condition was still such that he had not been able to consult with her as to her defense, a statement which was, in effect, a defense in itself. The postponement was granted, and Henrietta went back to her cell, to appear again in court the following February, 1854.</p>
				<p>The defense now stated that they were willing to pro-ceed, but this time the state objected, saying that new indictments were necessary, the original ones having been found faulty. So there was another postponement, and Henrietta's trial did not actually begin until May 22, 1854, almost a year to a day from the time that the murders were committed. The course of justice in the United States is usually slow and almost invariably uncertain.</p>
				<p>Before the date of the trial, however, an incident took place that is worth the telling. The account given in the Times of April 27, 1854, is sufficiently accurate and characteristic to quote verbatim:</p>
				<p>&quot;As usual, the Grand Jury, at the close of their session today, visited the jail for the purpose of seeing its in-mates. They visited the different apartments and found everything clean and in good order. Finally, the jailor, Mr. Hegeman, offered to conduct them to the room of Mrs. Robinson, in compliance with their particular request, as each one of them was very anxious to see her. The door was opened, and the jury with much dignity walked in. They surrounded a large rocking chair in which she sat closely vailed. Some of them very politely requested her to withdraw it. She made no response whatever, but sat perfectly silent and motionless. Their anxiety was so great, that they requested the jailer to remove the vail, which he respectfully declined to do. Finally, one of the jury stepped up and removed it himself, when to their very great surprise, no Mrs. Robinson was there, but on the contrary a silk dress neatly stuffed, after the latest Parisian fashion! The bird had flown—where? The jailer was asked if she had escaped. Search was instantly made. A slight titter, at length, was heard proceeding from under the bed. The curtain was raised, and there she lay, so full of laughter, that she could hardly contain herself. What increased the joke considerably was the fact that one of the jury, feeling himself punctured in his official dignity, made the affair the subject of a grave communication, denouncing it in very decided terms as 'discourteous conduct.'&quot;</p>
				<p>Which was all funny enough, and Troy cannot be blamed for laughing, but, on the other hand, it seems singularly unfortunate that Henrietta should be made a penny peepshow for the Grand Jury or anyone else. If their dignity was ruffed they had only their own indecent curiosity to thank for it. And this seems to have been the Times' point of view.</p>
				<p>Henrietta Robinson, she who had once been Charlotte Wood, was twenty-seven years old at this time, still young, still beautiful; her blue-black hair as lovely as ever, her deep blue eyes as full of charm. All that she had been through was not enough to wipe out the traces of the girl who had been gently born and finely bred. It was only her madness that betrayed her. Surely, it is not mere sentimentality to feel that the picture of this woman lying tittering under her bed in that bleak cell in the Troy jail for the edification of a crowd of gawping grand jurors is far more tragic than funny.</p>
				<p>On Monday, May 22, 1854, Henrietta Robinson was put on trial for her life.</p>
				<p>The trial lasted all of that week, and, though it was hotly contested, nothing of real importance was brought out that has not been set down here. There could be no possible doubt that Lanagan and Catherine Lubee had both been killed by arsenical poisoning; and there was no real doubt in anyone's mind that the arsenic had been administered by Henrietta. The only real question was as to her sanity, her legal responsibility for what she had done. The defense made much of the fact that she had no adequate motive for murder, but, since they were pleading her as insane, it was surely too much to expect a madwoman to behave rationally. Witness after witness was called to testify to various delusions that Henrietta had exhibited: delusions that would be of interest only to the student of morbid psychology, but which provided ample and unmistakable evidence of prolonged insanity.</p>
				<p>On one point, and that one of greater interest to the public than any other, no evidence was offered. Henrietta's identity was not touched upon. So far as the trial was con-cerned, she had no past. Her life began where the prosecution hoped to end it—in Troy; and she was to die, as she had lived, under her nom de guerre.</p>
				<p>This was in absolute accordance with Henrietta's own wishes. Sane or insane, that one secret she kept inviolate. From the first time she appeared in court, the prisoner kept her face covered by her heavy veil. The judge first re-quested, then implored, and finally demanded that Henrietta bare her face so that witnesses might, at least, be able to testify that she was the woman they were talking about. For a long time she held out against the combined efforts of court and counsel, but at last she consented to lift the veil for an instant, to permit recognition, and then, for a while, she kept it partially raised. The natural and correct inference was that she knew that there were people in Troy who would be able to identify her if once they had a good look at her.</p>
				<p>It was at this time that the newspapers began to refer to her as the &quot;Veiled Murderess.&quot;</p>
				<p>At a quarter after six on the afternoon of Saturday, May 27th, the presiding justice, Judge Harris, finished his charge, and the jury retired to consider their verdict. Henrietta drove back to the jail with the sheriff and his daughter, and Troy went home to a late dinner.</p>
				<p>Early in the evening the court was crowded again, seats, aisles, and galleries all packed with eager spectators, many of them women, some of whom had kept their places through the recess in the fear that once they gave them up they couldn't get them again. The court officers had to struggle to keep order, for the crowd was excited by the prospect of being &quot;in at the death.&quot;</p>
				<p>At eight-thirty Judge Harris was notified that the jury were ready, and, the prisoner having been sent for, the judge took his place on the bench. Judge Harris evidently anticipated the verdict, for as he sat, his head bowed in his hands, those nearest could see the tears as they came from between his fingers.</p>
				<p>Henrietta had confidently expected either an acquittal or a disagreement and, as she drove back to the court through the warm evening, she pressed the sheriff for his opinion. He refused, as gently as he could, to give her hope, and she wrung her hands together as she cried:</p>
				<p>&quot;Oh, that my brother William was here! If I could only see my brother William!&quot;</p>
				<p>William F. Wood was still busy denouncing all those who said that Henrietta was any connection whatever of his family.</p>
				<p>Henrietta, still wearing her impenetrable blue veil, came into the court and advanced to the bar. As she did so, she faltered a little, but she braced herself and stood firm. The jury entered and took their places. They were moved, so much so that some of them were in tears. At the question of the clerk of the court: &quot;How do you find the prisoner at the bar-guilty or not guilty?&quot; the foreman of the jury raised his head, and answered, &quot;Guilty.&quot; After that there was a moment's tense silence in the room, and then a great sigh that seemed to come from the entire crowd.</p>
				<p>Henrietta's composure, or daze, did not last long. The jury had no sooner been polled than she turned on the court like a termagant, shouting:</p>
				<p>&quot;Shame on you, Judge! Shame on you! There is corruption here!&quot;</p>
				<p>It took the concerted efforts of the friendly sheriff and his wife and daughter, along with the threats of her own counsel to abandon her, before she would be still.</p>
				<p>When she had been quieted, Henrietta's counsel asked that the court postpone passing sentence until the following Monday, in order that the defense might have the week-end in which to prepare and present some points touching on the legality of the indictment. It was certainly very late in the day for a motion of this kind, but the court, obviously desirous of giving the prisoner every possible advantage, granted the delay.</p>
				<p>So Henrietta was taken back to jail, and the court was cleared. There were murmurs from the crowd. The pack had been cheated of its kill.</p>
				<p>Even before eight o'clock on Monday morning, the streets near the courthouse were alive with people, and the police could clear a lane to the door only with diffi-culty. Indeed, there was a near riot, for hundreds of good citizens insisted on what they freely called their &quot;inalien-able rights,&quot; among which they appeared to count the sight of a woman facing sentence of death as one of the most important. (Even today, there is never an execution at Sing Sing that does not bring a list of hundreds of applications from those necrophiles who wish to be present.) More than half of the crowd were women.</p>
				<p>The judge took his seat, and the prisoner was brought in. Two women fainted.</p>
				<p>The defense now rose and argued for an indefinite suspension of sentence, so that they might have time to prepare and present a bill of exceptions to the higher court. After a brief argument, the plea was granted and the court adjourned.</p>
				<p>Henrietta went back to her cell.</p>
				<p>The crowd grumbled and went home. Again it had been cheated of the final curtain.</p>
				<p>This was on the 29th of May, 1854.</p>
				<p>Henrietta's case did not come up for argument before the Supreme Court until May, 1855, a full year later.</p>
				<p>Justice moves slowly in the United States.</p>
				<p>It was then two full years since the murders had been committed.</p>
				<p>A check of the newspapers of 1854 and '55, along with the various other accounts of this curious case, lead one to the probably erroneous conclusion that during the year that lapsed between the trial and the appeal nothing was talked about in Troy but the possible identity of Henrietta Robinson. People and papers grew almost hysterical in defense of their opposing theories.</p>
				<p>One faction maintained that Henrietta was Emma Wood, who had married Dr. McIntosh of the Royal Artillery. This was finally disproved, but only after long and bitter contention.</p>
				<p>At last it was established that one of the Wood girls was missing, but the family managed to muddle the trail so skillfully that it was difficult to tell which one this was, not to mention the further difficulty of identifying the hypothetical missing woman with Henrietta.</p>
				<p>The brother, William F. Wood, swore by all his gods and a dozen others that Henrietta was neither kith nor kin.</p>
				<p>Three incidents combined to show that he lied.</p>
				<p>First, a clergyman who had, some years before, often preached before the Female Seminary, went to the prison to see Henrietta, who greeted him with:</p>
				<p>&quot;I recognize you, sir. I used to hear you preach at the Ferry Street Church, when I was at school at the semi-nary.&quot; And she went on from there to speak of the &quot;revival' which had so stirred her in her school days.</p>
				<p>The clergyman, on his part, did not recognize her, but there was no reason why he should have been able to single her out from among a hundred other schoolgirls of ten years before. This is certainly evidence, of a kind, that Henrietta had gone to the seminary at the same period as Charlotte Wood, but it is no more than that. The second incident is more convincing.</p>
				<p>The Wood family had had, in Quebec, an Irish seamstress who had married and gone to live in Troy. She was there when Charlotte was in the seminary and remembered her well and with great affection. This woman, whose first name was Mary and whose last is not given, also paid a visit to the prison, at Henrietta's own request.</p>
				<p>No sooner had she entered the cell of the Veiled Murder-ess, than Henrietta threw her arms around the visitor's neck, crying out, &quot;Oh, Mary, I am so glad to see you!&quot; to which the older woman, bursting into tears, replied, &quot;Charlotte, Charlotte, is it indeed you?&quot;</p>
				<p>Mary stayed at the prison for a week, nearly all of the time in Henrietta's cell, sleeping and eating with her. She certainly must have known who it was for whom she had so great an affection.</p>
				<p>The third incident should have been, and was, except for those who had a special reason for differing, conclusive. There were a number of ladies in Troy who had been schoolmates of the Wood girls. One of these told a friend that if Henrietta Robinson was Charlotte Wood, it would be found that the little finger of her right hand was permanently crooked, as the result of a fall from a horse. Henrietta's hand was examined. The little finger of the right hand was crooked.</p>
				<p>As Emerson said, circumstantial evidence can sometimes be very conclusive—as when one finds a fish in the milk. The great majority of the students of crime will readily testify that circumstantial evidence is distinctly to be preferred to direct. All evidence is fallible, but circumstantial evidence is less so. Witnesses can and do lie; and, if they do not lie, they can be, and often are, mis-taken. Facts cannot lie of themselves, although they can be, and sometimes are, misinterpreted, either innocently or maliciously.</p>
				<p>Circumstantially, it was assuredly indicated, if not wholly proven, that Henrietta Robinson was Charlotte Wood. As this became increasingly clear, the prisoner was forced from one admission to another, until she was obliged to confess the truth.</p>
				<p>This did not still gossip, however, or hush the tongues of controversy. The Wood family persistently denied her. And just as, some forty years later, public opinion refused to believe that Lizzie Borden had murdered her father and stepmother with an ax, in spite of a web of circumstantial evidence that should have hanged her, so did that same opinion now refuse to credit the fact that Henrietta Robinson, kept woman and murderess, was identical with Charlotte Wood, aristocrat and beauty.</p>
				<p>Truly, to say that the voice of the people is the voice of God is the ultimate blasphemy.</p>
				<p>During all this period Henrietta's condition varied between a quiet semi-sanity and violent outbreaks of mad-ness. She would be quite calm and apparently rational for weeks, and then, upon no evident provocation, she would assault her jailer furiously, attacking him with whatever she could lay her hands on, and finishing her insane tantrum by smashing up all the furniture in her cell.</p>
				<p>In May, 1855, the Supreme Court rejected Henrietta's plea for a new trial, and it only remained for the trial court to pass sentence.</p>
				<p>When this bad news was brought to her, Henrietta called for candles, many candles. These she placed all about her cell, and when evening came she lighted them all, as if in celebration. A great crowd gathered in the street below, and when they saw the illumination they cheered.</p>
				<p>At three in the afternoon of the 19th of June, Henrietta Robinson appeared at the bar of the court for sentence to be passed upon her.</p>
				<p>Judge Harris spoke slowly and reluctantly:</p>
				<p>&quot;The sentence of the court is, that you, Henrietta Robinson, be detained in the county prison of the County of Rensselaer until the 3rd day of August next, and that on that day, between the hours of ten o'clock in the forenoon and two o'clock in the afternoon, you be hanged by the neck until you are dead, and may God, in his infinite mercy, save your soul.&quot;</p>
				<p>Henrietta drew herself up, and pointed her finger at the judge.</p>
				<p>&quot;Judge Harris, may the Judge of judges be your judge!&quot;</p>
				<p>It was over.</p>
				<p>It is a characteristic of the mob, both in England and the United States, that it will howl like a bloodthirsty maniac for the passing of the death sentence, and will then shriek with equal enthusiasm for its commutation.</p>
				<p>That is what happened in this instance. No sooner was Henrietta sentenced than all manner of people awoke to the realization that, since she was obviously mad, it would be wicked to carry the sentence out. Henrietta had no part in this. As she herself said, &quot;I might live thirty years in a prison, and death would be better.&quot;</p>
				<p>On the evening of the 27th of June the Governor of New York commuted the sentence of death to life imprisonment in Sing Sing.</p>
				<p>At four in the afternoon of the following day, Saturday, the sheriff and Henrietta started on their journey south to the prison. She had started off in one of her bad moods, vilifying the sheriff and everyone else within hearing, but once on the train she quieted down, and turning from the car window she said to her companion, &quot;You are going to take me home, aren't you?&quot; As the journey pro-gressed, she became more and more sure that they were on their way to Canada.</p>
				<p>It was after dark by the time they reached the great stone building on the bank of the Hudson.</p>
				<p>Sing Sing had been opened in 1830, and now, a quarter of a century later, its population was slightly less than one thousand. According to the records, in 1856, a year after Henrietta's admission, punishments of cold water, the ball and chain, the yoke, and dark cells were imposed in 501 cases of discipline. These were, of course, ordered punish-ments. They did not include the habitual brutality of the guards of that period.</p>
				<p>As the great gates swung to behind them, Henrietta seemed to awake to her position for the first time. She shrank back and begged the sheriff to tell her what they were doing in that place. She pleaded to be taken home, and implored that her brother William be sent for to take her away—that same brother who had sworn, and who was still to swear, that &quot;he did not know the woman.&quot; </p>
				<p>To the officer who was delegated to take the histories of the entering convicts, Henrietta returned vague answers, her one rational statement being that she was born in Quebec. The man finally gave up the task in disgust, only telling her that if she refused to answer the next time &quot;she would get cold water.&quot; Henrietta laughed. She did not understand.</p>
				<p>Sheriff Price, whose kindly pity had done more for Henrietta than she could ever know, said good-bye and went sadly back to Troy.</p>
				<p>The cells in Sing Sing then were steel units, seven feet long, seven feet high, and three and a quarter feet wide. They had little light or air and were filled with vermin. In summer they were dankly cold; in winter they were bitter.</p>
				<p>The woman who had once, ten years before, been Charlotte Wood of Quebec, who had had youth and beauty, birth and wealth, and who might once have been happy, entered one of those narrow, coffin-like cells, and the door clanged to behind her.</p>
				<p>William F. Wood nursed his smug respectability in Quebec.</p>
				<p>The only further reference to Henrietta Robinson that the writer has been able to discover is contained in a volume entitled, The New York Tombs: Its Secrets and Its Mysteries, published in 1874, and ghost-written for the warden of the Tombs by two newspaper men. The book, like most of its kind, is heavily moralistic, but it does contain an occasional scrap of information.</p>
				<p>In the first place, the authors identify Henrietta's mysterious lover as &quot;prominent state officer whose official duties demanded the personal supervision of the public works in that locality,&quot; that is, Troy. This is interesting but not especially enlightening. In the second, they give an incident, the only glimpse we are to have of Henrietta after her incarceration, that seems typical of her whole history.</p>
				<p>In 1856, the Governor of New York was Myron H. Clark, and, as all governors were in the habit of doing at that time, Governor Clark came to Sing Sing on a tour of inspection. While the governor and his staff were at dinner with the warden, the card of a gentleman was brought in requesting an interview. Here again identity is lost, for the gentleman is given simply as Mr. P—. In any event, it seems that Mr. P— had not only been thinking about the Veiled Murderess, but he had been dreaming about her as well; the results of his waking and dreaming fantasies being the conviction that Henrietta Robinson was, in reality, no other than a seamstress or governess whom he had employed in his family some time before and who had left him to go to England. There was much excitement at the dinner table, and Henrietta was produced forthwith.</p>
				<p>The succeeding interview must have been almost funny, for Mr. P—, whose own mental equipment seems not to have been of the best, babbled like the proverbial brook, and Henrietta, with the diabolical cleverness of the insane, caught up every clue from him as soon as he dropped it, embracing him, weeping on his neck, sobbing for the death of his wife, and, altogether, putting on a very good scene. Of course, Mr. P_ &quot;recognized&quot; her. He retired from the prison himself in tears.</p>
				<p>Governor Clark was, however, not quite so easy a mark. He put a man at work to investigate the story. The investigator, after some trouble, finally managed to run down the seamstress or governess, whose name is given to us as Emma M. H.-—, who was then living again in New York, and who freely acknowledged that she was the person in question. Taken to Mr. P_'s house and confronted with that gentleman, he denied her at once, alleging that she was an impostor and that the whole affair was a conspiracy designed to conceal the true identity of the woman calling herself Henrietta Robinson. The governor's investigator was somewhat aghast, but at that moment one of the ladies of the family entered and at once recognized Emma as being the person she said she was. The truth of the matter appears to be that the good Mr. P— was just a little cracked.</p>
				<p>A day or two later, the matron at Sing Sing, Mrs. Dewey, reproached Henrietta for imposing on the poor gentleman. Henrietta gave a mad chuckle and replied:</p>
				<p>&quot;The old fellow wanted to know me, and I thought I would gratify him. Didn't I moisten his broadcloth for him, though!&quot;</p>
				<p>For some years, Henrietta continued to give the Sing Sing matrons all the trouble that her twisted mind could suggest. At last she was sent to Auburn, where, at that time, was the asylum for the criminal insane. In 1874, twenty years after her trial and conviction, she was still alive there, &quot;grown gross in form and feature.&quot; Auburn today has no record of the case. It is not known when she died.</p>
				<p>The distance between Charlotte Wood of Quebec, young, rich, and lovely, and Henrietta Robinson of the Asylum for the Criminal Insane at Auburn is too great to be measured. May she rest in peace.</p>

				<head type="chapter">SEVEN WHO WERE SILENT</head>
				<p>SEVEN who were silent, and who remained so to the end; a poison so subtle that it is difficult to detect even today, and which was almost unheard of by the layman at the time it was used—the first time it was ever used in America. But, above all—silence.</p>
				<p>In one of the earlier Sherlock Holmes stories, Holmes and Watson were journeying out of town on a professional mission. Watson looked out of the train window at the rolling hills and the red and gray roofs of the farm buildings that shot past.</p>
				<p>&quot;Are they not fresh and beautiful?' I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.</p>
				<p>&quot;But Holmes shook his head gravely.</p>
				<p>&quot;'Do you know, Watson,' said he, 'that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought that comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there. ... But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser!'&quot; </p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes was right. There are numberless cases in the long red chronicle of crime that bear out his state-ment. And among them all there cannot be found a better example than that of the strange murder that was committed in the little township of Bethlehem, New York, in 1853.</p>
				<p>In 1853, Bethlehem was about nine miles from Albany, which at that time boasted a population of some fifty thousand souls, but nowadays Albany has reached well out into the country, so that the modern Bethlehem is a little nearer the metropolis. Perhaps the phrase &quot;modern Bethlehem&quot; is not altogether correct, for many of the towns of the smiling Hudson Valley have resisted the march of time and have managed to retain no small portion of their old charm. And eighty years ago, when the events of this story took place, the valley was more thinly settled than now, and far more old-fashioned and out-of-the-world than it is today. But, summer or winter, the valley of the Hudson is one of the most beautiful valleys in the world.</p>
				<p>On an evening in early March, 1853, young Wendell Oliver tucked in his buffalo robe and slapped the reins on the back of his little gray mare. The sleighing was still good in the Hudson Valley, and Wendell Oliver was taking advantage of it. The sleigh runners squeaked on the hard-packed snow of the highroad as the mare turned out of the Haswell lane, and Oliver recognized the sound as a sign of more cold weather.</p>
				<p>Wendell had brought Louisa Haswell home from church that Sunday and had spent the evening in the warm farmhouse kitchen. Louisa's parents had tactfully gone to bed early. It was late now. &quot;Must be round midnight,&quot; Oliver thought. He leaned forward and rattled the whiffletree to urge Jenny on. The mare's neat black hoofs flung pellets of snow against the dashboard, and they covered the first mile at a smart trot. That brought them as far as the Hendricksons', and as they passed the house Oliver noticed something unusual.</p>
				<p>There was a light in the window upstairs.</p>
				<p>It was late for anyone to be up in that household, and Oliver wondered about the light. He had seen the Hen-dricksons at church earlier in the evening, but:</p>
				<p>&quot;Must be someone sick,&quot; thought Oliver.</p>
				<p>Young Wendell had promised to call for his friend Aaron Palmatier, who was spending the evening courting at the Mead house, a half mile up the road.</p>
				<p>Upstairs, in their beds, Jeremiah Mead and his hired man heard the clock strike one and soon afterward heard the jingle of Oliver's sleigh bells and the subdued good-nights downstairs. That clock was fast, Jerry Mead remembered. About an hour fast. It was really around twelve, and it was quite time that young fellow downstairs went home. Young people nowadays sat up till all hours ... not when he was a boy ... he dozed.</p>
				<p>&quot;Saw a light in the Hendricksons' as I came by,&quot; Oliver commented to Aaron Palmatier as they drove homeward. &quot;Must be someone is sick.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;They were at church this evening,&quot; Aaron replied. &quot;Maybe John was out late—for a change!&quot;</p>
				<p>They both laughed.</p>
				<p>They did not know then that death had lighted a candle.</p>
				<p>Young John Hendrickson and his wife Maria were a favorite topic of conversation when the gossips sat around the redhot stove in the crossroads store; and this had been true since their marriage two years before. They were an ill-assorted pair.</p>
				<p>John Hendrickson, a good-looking, rowdy young ne'er-do-well of nineteen, son of a poor Bethlehem family, without prospects, would have been unsuitable enough as a match for Maria Van Dusen even if his reputation had been a good one and it wasn't a good one. He was an idle, unprincipled young rake, with a distinct weakness for gin, cards, and women. With women, undeniably, John Hendrickson had a way with him, a bad way.</p>
				<p>The Van Dusens were the substantial family of Clarks-ville, which was only a short distance from Bethlehem, where the Hendricksons lived. Only recently Lawrence Van Dusen, Maria's father, had retired from the clerkship of Albany County, an important and lucrative post, possessed of a comfortable income which was regarded by his neighbors as wealth. There were well filled mows and sleek cattle in the Van Dusen barns, well ordered and substantial comfort in the Van Dusen house. Perhaps the phrase, &quot;rich and respectable&quot; describes them. And Maria, seven-teen, pretty and strong willed, was the youngest daughter and the spoiled darling of the family.</p>
				<p>In contrast to this, the Hendricksons were little better than &quot;poor whites,&quot; and John Hendrickson junior was the worst of the litter.</p>
				<p>The Van Dusens had protested against the marriage, but Maria was too used to having her own way to give in, and ultimately they had consented with what grace they could muster. And so, with misgivings in which the entire community enthusiastically joined, the Van Dusens accepted the situation, and in January, 1851, the pair were married and came home to the Van Dusen house to live. The Hendricksons had no room for them, and at least the arrangement permitted the Van Dusens to keep an eye on things. An older sister and a son of the family were both married, happily and suitably, in neighboring communi-ties, and Maria and her brother Lawrence were the only children living at home.</p>
				<p>This mixed household, in which Hendrickson was far from popular, was a poor start for any marriage, but in this instance it probably made little difference. The match was doomed from the beginning.</p>
				<p>Any woman who marries a man to reform him is a fool, and pretty Maria Hendrickson was no exception. She was only seventeen, pretty, spoiled, and stubborn. She was plump, with masses of glossy brown hair, and charming blue eyes; quite attractive enough to have caught the roving fancy of John Hendrickson-aside from the Van Dusen money—but not attractive enough to hold it. It is very unlikely that any woman could have held it for long.</p>
				<p>Maria was lively but not gay, and she was &quot;good.&quot; She disapproved of her husband's rowdy companions, disapproved of his card playing and his drinking, and yet, disapproving of his habits and his friends, she was infatuated with him and fiercely possessive. Books have been written to explain women like Maria, just as books have been written to explain the weather, but neither the weather nor the women have been affected. Maria was pious. She nagged. By the end of three months John Hendrickson was tired of her and had resumed his old ways.</p>
				<p>In the spring of '51, Maria was pregnant. Now that she was going to have a baby, friends of the young pair reassured themselves. Boys will be boys, but when they become fathers they settle down. Or, at any rate, they do in books. But this wasn't that kind of a book. Maria expected her baby in November.</p>
				<p>That summer Clarksville was shocked from its accustomed quiet by an attempted assault upon a respectable young woman, who promptly identified John Hendrickson as her assailant. It was an almost unheard-of outrage in the law-abiding little community, and the town was altogether too hot for Hendrickson. So he went off to Corning, about a hundred and fifty miles away, to let the storm blow over. Lawrence Van Dusen was not cordial when he gave his son-in-law the money to get him out of the way of the law.</p>
				<p>Travel was slow in those days, and distances relatively greater than now, so John broke the journey to Corning with a stop at Warnersville, Schoharie County. At John Townsend's public house his practised eye dwelt approvingly on the neat figure of Jane Bailey, twenty, maid-of-all-work. Mr. Hendrickson himself was a fast worker, but Miss Bailey did not succumb at once. It was only upon the second evening of his blandishments, and after a promise of marriage, that her scruples were overcome. From &quot;the edge of the evening until four o'clock in the morning&quot; they remained in each other's embraces. This seems to have been a digression common enough in the life of the traveler in Schoharie County in those days, judging from the later comments of contemporaries, and Jane herself testified that nothing had &quot;happened&quot; until after they became &quot;engaged.&quot; So that was all right. Jane wrote Mr. Hendrickson later to remind him of their sacred vows and to notify him of her preparations for their marriage.</p>
				<p>In all this it must be remembered that this drab and sordid background, against which the final drama of horror was played, is essential to a proper understanding of the plot of the story. Murder does not spring full blown from the mind. It is rooted as deeply as the deadly nightshade in the soil of evil. It is necessary that we see the gathering of the clouds on the horizon in order that we may fully appreciate the dark terror of the storm that is to come.</p>
				<p>Of the sojourn in Corning nothing is known, excepting as it may be inferred from subsequent events.</p>
				<p>In November, Maria's baby was born, and soon after-wards, three months having now elapsed since the Clarksville assault, John Hendrickson came home. For the sake of the Van Dusens, the town was ready enough to let bygones be bygones, and the charge was not pressed.</p>
				<p>At the Van Dusen house, Maria sat up in the big mahogany four-poster, her dark hair falling on the white pillowcases with their ruffed edges, and held John Hen-drickson's baby to her full white breast. The family was in a pleased flutter. John came in, kissed Maria, and picked the baby up, awkwardly, with an embarrassed laugh. There were no reproaches.</p>
				<p>Six weeks later Maria took the baby and paid a visit to John's family in Bethlehem. And there, in circumstances that were never fully explained, the baby died. It was found dead, sleeping with its parents, lying lifeless on the outer edge of the bed, next to its father. Had it been smothered under the clothes? Had John lain on it? No one ever knew. At any rate, John had not wanted the baby, and now the baby was dead. Mrs. Van Dusen comforted her daughter, and thereafter, when the baby's death was mentioned, she looked narrowly at her son-in-law.</p>
				<p>That month Maria's ill health became more pronounced. She complained of continual pain, and in January of 1852 she confided symptoms to her mother which set Mrs. Van Dusen's lips in a hard line. She sent for Dr. Spring-steed of Albany.</p>
				<p>With Maria's continued indisposition and Dr. Spring-steed's repeated visits, Lawrence Van Dusen insisted on knowing just what ailed his daughter. Dr. Springsteed told him. John Hendrickson's philanderings had given him a disease with which he had infected Maria. Charged with the fact, John gave one of the most remarkable explanations on record. He said that on his recent visit to Corning he had &quot;fallen down in the train.&quot; Maria may have been naive, but she was not as naive as all that. There was a very painful scene.</p>
				<p>The contrasting points of view of John and Maria on this episode are entirely characteristic. To Hendrickson, it was as natural, as inevitable, and as unimportant en the headache that follows a drinking bout. To Maria, it brought a sense of shame, humiliation, and disgust that even outweighed the dire physical effects.</p>
				<p>Listening to her bitter reproaches, John Hendrickson glowered out of the window, looking with baffled fury at the ample Van Dusen barns and the wide Van Dusen acres that had tempted him into this tiresome marriage. Then he turned, sneered at her distorted, tear-stained face, and walked out of the room. Downstairs he encountered his father-in-law, who ordered him out of the house.</p>
				<p>With this dismissal, the story of John and Maria Hendrickson might, and should, have ended, had it not been for Maria's insane infatuation, and for the conventions of the day which placed the fact of marriage above any of the evils that might result from the fact.</p>
				<p>After Mr. Van Dusen had ordered him out, John Hendrickson went back to live with his parents at Bethle-hem, and presently was philandering again as gayly as ever.</p>
				<p>But Maria had no intention of letting her John go. That winter she paid visits to the Hendrickson family, and by the spring of '52 the pair were so far reconciled that John arranged with a relative in Albany to have Maria visit there while she was being treated by Dr. Springsteed.</p>
				<p>Just at this juncture, a letter from Miss Jane Bailey to John, reminding him of their engagement, fell into Maria's hands and threatened their new peace. But somehow John explained it away. He could explain anything except murder.</p>
				<p>For the young Hendricksons, the summer of 1852 in the smiling Hudson Valley was one of repeated quarrels and reconciliations. Maria had pretty well recovered her health, and as the summer advanced John paid occasional visits to the Van Dusen house. There were periods of calm as well as tempest, but the tempests were more frequent and marked the gathering storm.</p>
				<p>Then, in October, Lawrence Van Dusen died.</p>
				<p>Any expectations that John Hendrickson may have had of profiting under the will, if he was foolish enough to have any, were soon dispelled. The Van Dusen property was left, during her lifetime, to Mrs. Van Dusen, a woman of ffty who was in excellent health, with a one-fourth share to Maria on the death of her mother. John Hendrickson was not even mentioned.</p>
				<p>Disappointed in his own expectations, Hendrickson swaggered in the rôle of Maria's husband. He demanded an inventory taken of the property. He began to assert himself. It was after one of his outbursts, during which he had cursed her in a forthright manner, that Maria told him that whatever became of her share of her mother's estate, at least he would never get any of it!</p>
				<p>One December morning John talked of going in to Albany for the day. He was pulling on his heavy blue overcoat in the kitchen, his knitted cap and mittens on a chair by the door, when Mrs. Van Dusen came in. She sat down and picked up her knitting.</p>
				<p>&quot;Maria,&quot; said John, &quot;shan't I get you some medicine in town?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;No, John,&quot; said his wife.</p>
				<p>John put on his cap, pulled on his mittens, and, with one hand on the door latch, turned to his wife, asking again:</p>
				<p>&quot;Maria, shan't I get you some medicine?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Maria emphatically. &quot;You just want to get me some of that poison that you got last summer, that I wouldn't take, and burnt up!&quot;</p>
				<p>Mrs. Van Dusen looked up from her work, startled.</p>
				<p>&quot;Poison, Maria?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes, Mother. You never saw it. I burnt it up.&quot; </p>
				<p>John Hendrickson made no reply. He walked out of the kitchen door.</p>
				<p>Much was made of this incident afterwards, though it was admitted that medicine is often spoken of as &quot;poison&quot; in the country.</p>
				<p>Of one thing, this and other incidents of the kind are proof, and that is that Mrs. Van Dusen never missed an opportunity to widen the breach between the pair. Later events showed very clearly her dislike and distrust of her son-in-law and how well both feelings were justified.</p>
				<p>The next month, January of '53, Hendrickson had in even more tangible grudge against Mrs. Van Dusen. He applied to her for the lease of the Clarksville farm for that year, and she refused to let him have it. Instead, she leased it to a stranger named Long. That month John Hendrickson met Maria's brother-in-law, Frederick Hungerford, her sister Susannah's husband, in Clarksville. John was in a black mood.</p>
				<p>&quot;The old lady,&quot; said he, &quot;has let out the place to Long.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;I thought,&quot; replied Hungerford, &quot;that you were to have it.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;I wanted it,&quot; answered Hendrickson, &quot;but she wouldn't let me have it.&quot; Truculently, he added, &quot;They won't gain anything by it.&quot;</p>
				<p>The remark may have been nothing more than a bit of the swagger to which he was prone, but Hungerford was to remember it later and to endow it, naturally enough in the light of later events, with the ring of a threat.</p>
				<p>Rehearsing what he felt to be his injuries at the hands of the Van Dusens, John Hendrickson must have felt that, so far from profiting by his marriage, he had gained no more than a stupid young wife who nagged him and who was always in tears. He was tired of her. He had been cheated of his &quot;rights.&quot; He wished to be rid of her.</p>
				<p>Events moved swiftly now to their calamitous and fearful end.</p>
				<p>Towards the middle of the month Maria went to Bethlehem to visit the Hendricksons. January merged into February, and February is a short month.</p>
				<p>March came in, bringing the inauguration of President Franklin Pierce. There was good sleighing, and the Hendricksons' neighbors went back and forth on their errands to Albany, where they stopped at the Knickerbocker for dinner and dropped into the public houses and stores to gossip.</p>
				<p>On the second of the month, William Haswell and Jerry Haight sat by the stove at the back of Springsteed &amp; Bullock's drug store, on the corner of Lydius and Pearl streets, swapping news with the proprietor. A customer came in, not noticing the two in the back of the store, and Mr. Springsteed, who knew him, went forward to wait on him. The customer asked for prussic acid. Mr. Springsteed did not have any, but told him where he thought he could get it. The customer was John Hendrickson.</p>
				<p>Springsteed does not seem to have thought anything about the episode at the time. It did not strike him as unusual. There were no laws against the purchase of poison by anyone who wanted it and could pay for it. Country people were always dosing themselves, and if they wanted to dose with prussic acid, that was their busi-ness. Thirty-eight years later, in Fall River, Lizzie Borden was to try to buy prussic acid and was to be refused. Times had changed.</p>
				<p>John Hendrickson went, at Mr. Springsteed's sugges-tion, to another pharmacist, Burroughs, at the corner of South Pearl and Plain streets. There, he did not ask for prussic acid, but for &quot;sixpence worth of aconite.&quot; Mr. Burroughs sold him an ounce vial of tincture of aconite from a gallon he had just prepared. The pharmacist, unlike Mr. Springsteed, did not know his customer, but he later identified him as wearing a blue overcoat and a knitted cap, and as being a tall young man with a high color.</p>
				<p>On the Saturday following this, Maria Hendrickson, with her mother-in-law and John's two sisters, went to pay a call at her aunt's, Mrs. Slingerland's.</p>
				<p>It was mid-afternoon, but the Slingerland family had only just finished their noon dinner and were still at the table. The guests were asked to have something to eat but declined. They had already had dinner, they said. Maria, however, insisted that she was hungry again.</p>
				<p>She had had a long walk in the open air. Perhaps the Hendrickson meal had not been very tempting.</p>
				<p>So she tossed off her wraps, stood at the table, and ate apple sauce, a piece of sausage, and a slice of johnny cake, and washed it down with two cups of tea. She was in high spirits. She was going home to her mother's the next day, she said.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Slingerland was to remember her excellent appetite, and the picture of radiant health that Maria made, laughing and talking as she ate, that windy March after-noon.</p>
				<p>The Hendrickson house was a small, rather shabby affair. It was only one story high with an attic overhead. Downstairs, there were three bedrooms. In one of these slept John's brother, Matthew Hendrickson, and his wife. Mr. and Mrs. Hendrickson senior had the second. And in the third slept John's two unmarried sisters. As a rule, John and Maria slept in the same room with the two girls, but just about the first of March the young couple moved to an attic room that had been used by a farm hand, but which was then vacant. This attic room could only be reached by a narrow stairway that ran up from Matthew's bedroom; and the only heat that reached the attic room came from a stovepipe that ran up from Matthew's room to the one above.</p>
				<p>Eight people were in the shabby little house. Seven who were silent.</p>
				<p>Saturday was the 5th of March.</p>
				<p>On Sunday evening, March 6th, the elder Mr. Hendrick-son, John, and Maria and the two sisters went to church, two miles away. On the way home John stopped at the tavern to pick up his father's &quot;boot,&quot; a waterproof lap robe, which had been left there, and to have a drink. The rest of the party went home ahead of him. This was about nine o'clock or a little after, in the evening.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Hendrickson senior had a cold and had stayed at home, taken simple remedies, and gone to bed. Matthew and his wife, who had also stayed at home, had gone to bed in their room by the time the party got back from church.</p>
				<p>On her return, Maria sat in the parlor for a while, waiting for John and reading aloud to the others from the Bible and from a religious paper. Sunday was not yet over. It was a black night, and the March wind made the boughs of the trees creak and rattle.</p>
				<p>At about ten o'clock John returned with the &quot;boot,&quot; and he and Maria tiptoed their way through the bedroom where Matthew and his wife were sleeping, took from the table the candle that Mrs. Matthew had left for them, and went upstairs to their attic room to bed.</p>
				<p>One assumes that their undressing was not prolonged in that cold room, and that the candle had not burned down very far by the time they put it out. Just what became of that candle was one of the many questions that was asked and never answered, later. Perhaps it furnished the light that Wendell Oliver saw two hours later, driving home from the Haswells' after midnight.</p>
				<p>Perhaps...</p>
				<p>What went on in that bleak garret room during that evil night will never truly be known. Surely the soughing of the wind as it whistled through the trees and found its way through many a crack into the barren attic room must have spoken with the voice of devils.</p>
				<p>There were seven persons who must have known what happened, but those seven were silent—silent to the very end.</p>
				<p>For the second time that night sleigh bells stopped at the Mead farmhouse, and Jeremiah Mead wakened to listen. Someone knocked, first slowly and then wildly. Jerry Mead put his head out of an upper window. It was only three o'clock, but the white blanket of snow threw a queer gray light that penetrated the darkness and at the same time made it seem more black. In the ghostly light Mead recognized Matthew Hendrickson.</p>
				<p>&quot;What's the matter, Matthew?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Can Mrs. Mead come over to the house?&quot; Matthew said, his voice curiously shaken. &quot;John's wife is dead.&quot; </p>
				<p>Jeremiah Mead and his wife Lucy climbed the narrow stairs from Matthew Hendrickson's bedroom to the attic.</p>
				<p>There were two small windows in the north wall of the little attic room. They were hung with cheap paper curtains that made the room seem even colder than it was. Under one of the windows was a chest, and on it, fully dressed, sat young John Hendrickson, his head in his hands. One of his sisters was in the room. The attic, bare and squalid, without floor covering, was lit feebly by an oil lamp. The room stank of death. On the bed, stiffly stretched at full length, lay the body of Maria, her eyes closed, her brown hair undisturbed, the bedclothes drawn up to her chin.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Mead turned back the covers and felt Maria's heart. There was no beat. She felt the body and noted that while the extremities were cold, the stomach was still warm. She motioned to her husband, who also felt the body and noticed its temperature. Undoubtedly Maria was dead. What had happened? Questioningly, the woman looked up, only to meet the frightened but impassive face of the sister. John sat unmoved. Neither of them spoke. Something warned Lucy Mead to ask no questions.</p>
				<p>Country neighbors are used to being called in at times of birth and death, and so, as a matter of course, the Meads stayed to give what help they could. Lucy Mead helped to &quot;lay out the body.&quot; Jeremiah helped Matthew to carry it downstairs, awkwardly, for the stairs were narrow and steep, and the dead woman was heavy. The sound of their leaden, shuffling footsteps filled the house. They carried Maria into the little parlor, where she had been reading aloud from the Bible only a few hours before, and placed her on an improvised bier.</p>
				<p>At no time, then or later, was anything said to explain this sudden, terrible event. There was no comment. No expression of grief. No words were spoken. There was only —silence.</p>
				<p>Jeremiah went home to feed the cows, but Lucy stayed on.</p>
				<p>Later that morning John Hendrickson went into the parlor, bent over his wife's body, and kissed her.</p>
				<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;that she could only be alive again!&quot;</p>
				<p>That was all.</p>
				<p>As the day advanced, the news spread, more neighbors came, and—with less consideration or with suspicions more dreadful than the Meads'—asked questions. Some of them had seen Maria at church the night before. She had seemed to be in her usual health then. What had happened?</p>
				<p>But the Hendricksons had nothing to say.</p>
				<p>The neighborhood was stirred by conjecture and then by rumor.</p>
				<p>Finally, a story was told.</p>
				<p>John and Maria had gone to bed about ten o'clock. At about three in the morning-later, this became two, not three they had been roused by a call from John, &quot;Mat-thew, bring a light!&quot;</p>
				<p>John explained that he had wakened, found himself crowded by Maria, and told her to move over. She had not answered. He put his hand on her and found her cold. It was then that he had called to his brother. Matthew had lit a candle, rushed upstairs, and, roused, the whole family had followed him. They had found John sitting up in bed, Maria's body stretched out stiffly beside him. They tried to revive her. They did not think, they said, that she was dead.</p>
				<p>Matthew's wife ran downstairs for a bottle of camphor. Old Mrs. Hendrickson and her husband rubbed Maria's arms. They poured camphor on her stomach, loosened her nightcap, and rubbed her temples with camphor; raised her up and poured camphor between her teeth. So they said. They didn't send for a doctor, but Matthew went for the Meads. Over and over, they told the same story.</p>
				<p>Hadn't they heard any sound of distress, any outcry from Maria? No-nothing. She couldn't have had a fit, for her nightcap was in place, her hair smooth under it, and the bedclothes undisturbed. And, moreover, old Mrs. Hendrickson had been awake the whole night. She had been in discomfort with her cold and had had to sit up in bed. She knew there had been no sound, for, in that ramshackle house, she must have heard even a mouse stirring. And she had heard nothing? No—nothing.</p>
				<p>Seven people had remained quite undisturbed in that frame house, its partitions so thin that the slightest movement or word could be heard from one room to the next.</p>
				<p>And from ten o'clock at night until three in the morning they had heard—nothing.</p>
				<p>The neighbors left, many of them exchanging troubled glances. Many-tongued rumor flew.</p>
				<p>That afternoon they took Maria's dead body home to her mother. Mrs. Van Dusen, after one look at it, knew that her daughter had not died naturally. There was more than mere distrust of her son-in-law in this. There were material facts. Maria's face was curiously swollen and of a strange undeathlike pallor. The flesh was oddly spongy. The lips were blue, and there was a bruise on the outside of the lip that showed as a cut inside. And, although the body showed an unnatural rigidity, even allowing for rigor mor-tis, when the mother lifted one of the arms, it fell back into place with an uncanny elasticity. Country people are used to the sight of death, and this was not the only corpse that Mrs. Van Dusen had seen. But this corpse was different, strangely, horribly different.</p>
				<p>There was accusation in Mrs. Van Dusen's eyes and on her lips when the coroner arrived.</p>
				<p>That evening the coroner summoned two other physicians to inspect the body. Meantime, the Albany druggist, William Springsteed, hearing of the sudden and mysterious death of Maria Hendrickson, recalled that her husband had been in his shop the week before inquiring for prussic acid. He notified the coroner promptly. The inquest was held that same evening.</p>
				<p>John Hendrickson, being called, repeated his story of Maria's death, adding that she had complained constantly of pain that Sunday, but that otherwise she had been in her usual health and had eaten regularly. Asked about his recent trips to Albany, he said that he had been there &quot;two weeks ago last Sunday.&quot; Interrogated further, he said, as if correcting himself, &quot;Oh, yes! I believe it was a week ago last Saturday.&quot; And when the same question was put a third time, he remembered that &quot;It was last Satur-day.&quot; He never admitted to the visit, earlier in the week, to which there were many witnesses. He gave, or purported to give, a circumstantial account of the visit that he admitted to the city, but he could not remember having been in Springsteed &amp; Bullock's store, did not even know the location of any other drug stores, and finally, &quot;when asked whether he had been in a drug store at all, looked up as if startled at the question, hesitated, and did not remember.&quot; It was a painfully bad showing.</p>
				<p>The coroner found the circumstances sufficient to warrant a post mortem, and the physicians stayed in the neighborhood so that they might conduct it the next day. Tuesday morning, Stephen Van Dusen, Maria's brother, arrived from Berne, a few miles away. On entering the Van Dusen kitchen, Stephen found John Hendrickson, his head resting on the back of a chair in front of him, staring down at the floor. Stephen asked whether he could see his sister's body. John assented, dully, and directed him to the front of the house. When Stephen returned to the kitchen, John had gone. The brother went out to the wood shed, where he found John, his thumbs hooked in the armholes of his vest, his head bent, still staring at the ground.</p>
				<p>Nothing in the chronicle of John and Maria Hendrickson is so sinister as the silences that shriek out of it. The silence of the house the night that Maria died. The silence of the family when the Meads were there that fatal morning. And now the silence of Maria's brother.</p>
				<p>There is no evidence that Stephen Van Dusen did or did not suspect his sister's murder at this time, and it may be that he was simply inarticulate, gauche. It may be-otherwise. Stephen looked idly around the wood shed, and said:</p>
				<p>&quot;Mother has poor wood to burn. It ought to be cut up so it could dry.&quot;</p>
				<p>John answered him mechanically. The suspense was telling on him. Surely Stephen had more than that to say! This studied silence about Maria was worse than open accusation. John couldn't stand it any longer.</p>
				<p>&quot;Have you seen Maria?&quot; he asked.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Stephen.</p>
				<p>Nothing more. No regret, no reproach, no accusation. If there was anything in Stephen Van Dusen's mind he kept it to himself. At that moment John Hendrickson was as near to funk as he ever came to 'be.</p>
				<p>&quot;What are they doing?&quot; he said.</p>
				<p>Stephen told him that the coroner and the other doctors were in consultation. The autopsy was in progress.</p>
				<p>&quot;Go in,&quot; urged Hendrickson, &quot;and ask if they are willing for me to send for Dr. Springsteed.&quot;</p>
				<p>Stephen went and came back, faintly nauseated from the sight and smells of the front room, its windows open a crack at top and bottom, the homely earthenware bowl of dreadful relics sitting among the bric-à-brac on the mantel-piece. John was standing where he had left him, and before Stephen got up to him John called out:</p>
				<p>&quot;What are they doing? What do they find?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;They are taking out the stomach. I don't know that they have found much of anything.&quot; </p>
				<p>And then John Hendrickson's conscience spoke through his pallid lips.</p>
				<p>&quot;One thing I know. They won't find arsenic!&quot;</p>
				<p>It was a mild March day, thawing and sunny; and the livestock had been turned out into the barnyard. John pointed out some hens and a cow that had belonged to Maria. There were some sheep lying on the hay, and when Stephen drove them off, John commented that two of them were Maria's, that her father had given them to her. With dreadful fascination the subject of Maria held him.</p>
				<p>&quot;She didn't live to enjoy them,&quot; said Stephen.</p>
				<p>&quot;No,&quot; said John, &quot;she is dead.&quot;</p>
				<p>He was obsessed with the desire to talk. He rehearsed the scene of Maria's death as he had told it that morning. They had gone to bed at ten. He had wakened at two. And so on. Stephen, either from delicacy or distaste, merely replied that &quot;it was a very sudden death,&quot; and tried to change the subject. He inquired what share of the farm the tenant, Long, had. Bitterly, John repeated his complaints that he had been refused the lease of the farm. And, stoically, Maria's brother remarked that perhaps it was just as well, since Maria was dead.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said John, &quot;she is dead. We went to sleep at eleven. I woke at three.&quot;</p>
				<p>He repeated his story again, and Stephen noticed that in this recital there was an hour's difference in the time.</p>
				<p>The autopsy was over.</p>
				<p>Three practised physicians were satisfied that Maria Hendrickson had been poisoned, and that, from the condition of her stomach and intestines, she had vomited, perhaps for as much as an hour and a half, before she died. She must have died, they said, in fearful convulsive agony.</p>
				<p>Maria Hendrickson had fought hard for life. It was preposterous to believe that the occupants of that little farm-house, much less the husband who lay by her side, had been unaware of her agony.</p>
				<p>The next day, the sheriff and his deputy came to the Van Dusen house and arrested John Hendrickson for murder.</p>
				<p>Sitting beside sheriff and deputy in the house after his arrest, Hendrickson asked:</p>
				<p>&quot;Have they found any poison?&quot;</p>
				<p>The deputy said that he did not know.</p>
				<p>&quot;Suppose,&quot; Hendrickson continued, &quot;suppose they had put poison in her stomach yesterday. Could it be found?&quot; The deputy asked whom he meant by &quot;they.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;The doctors,&quot; Hendrickson said darkly.</p>
				<p>The deputy retorted that &quot;they would do no such thing,&quot; but he remembered the remark. It was Hendrick-son's second slip.</p>
				<p>The prosecution was to allude to it afterwards, and to comment:</p>
				<p>&quot;We have often heard it remarked in regard to the trial of Robinson for the murder of Helen Jewett, that one simple remark which he made to the officer at the time of his arrest, and before the officer had informed him of the offense with which he was charged, was convincing proof of his guilt. That remark was-Why do you arrest me? I have not committed the murder.'&quot;</p>
				<p>Robinson's trial took place in New York in 1836. The prosecution might have adduced even more effectively the famous remark of Professor Webster when he was told that Dr. Parkman's body had been found: &quot;Have they found all the body?&quot; For it was only three years before, in 1850, that Professor Webster had murdered Parkman and burned his body. Or, had they been endowed with the gift of prophecy, the prosecution might have cited the remark that Steinie Morrison was to make to Inspector Wensley of Scotland Yard, in 1911: &quot;You have accused me of murder&quot;; and that before any charge had been laid against him. True, murder does not always out, but there have been notable occasions when it fairly babbled to betray itself.</p>
				<p>There was nothing approaching modern police procedure in Albany County, in 1853, and the Hendrickson house was not searched for traces of the stained nightclothes and bed linen which would have established the fact of Maria's continued and violent nausea to a country jury as medical inference never could. Whatever the suspicions of the Meads, they were obliged to testify that there were no such traces present when they arrived. Of course, the soiled linen could have been concealed. There were two chests in the attic room, and John Hendrickson had sat on one of them the whole time the Meads were there. But this was mere surmise not proof.</p>
				<p>Twenty years later, a somewhat similar case of poison-ing, the Bravo case, was detected by the discovery of traces of vomit on a window ledge, where it had been thrown out of the window. In the Hendrickson case, the prosecution contended that this was what had happened, but nothing seems to have been done to verify the assumption.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, direct proof being absent, circumstantial evidence began to be gathered and to be pieced together for the coroner's jury.</p>
				<p>There was the evidence of William Haswell and Jerry Haight, who had seen the prisoner in Springsteed's drug store in Albany, and the evidence of the proprietor himself that Hendrickson had asked for prussic acid.</p>
				<p>There was the evidence of the Hendrickson family that Maria had eaten as usual on Sunday, and of Mrs. Slinger-land that Maria had eaten heartily at her house the day before.</p>
				<p>And there was the evidence of the doctors that Maria's stomach and intestines were more empty than would have been possible had she not been violently sick.</p>
				<p>There was the evidence of a bruise on her lip and a cut inside, where some hard object had been pressed against her mouth. The bruise had not been there the day before, and the doctors testified that it could not have been made after death. Was it a little glass vial that had been forced between her teeth?</p>
				<p>And there was the evidence of the light upstairs.</p>
				<p>Wendell Oliver told of passing the Hendrickson house about midnight on that ill-starred Sunday, and of seeing a light in the attic window. It was from an hour and a half to two hours later that Matthew Hendrickson had driven to the Meads', only a half mile away. The light Oliver had seen could not have been the light that Matthew brought at his brother's call, between two and three o'clock in the morning.</p>
				<p>Horror stricken, Albany County tried to picture the scene that must have taken place in that bleak little attic room. It was sufficiently shocking that Maria, young, pretty, the spoiled and beloved daughter of the rich and respectable Van Dusens, should have died in that com-fortless, squalid attic: but that she should have been dying there for more than an hour, twisting, writhing, convulsed with agony and sick unto death ... ! </p>
				<p>How the deed had been accomplished, they could only guess. It is no easy task to force a dose down an unwilling throat. Had Maria been tricked into taking the poison willingly? There were no bruises or other marks of violence on her throat and body. Only that curiously cut hip which seemed to indicate that some hard object had been pressed against her stubborn mouth. Could one person have accomplished this, or had there been an accomplice? Or, perhaps, many accomplices? Seven persons knew, but no one told. Late travelers on that road, passing the Hendrickson house in the spring of 1853, felt a superstitious dread as they whipped up their horses.</p>
				<p>No one seems to have had the slightest doubt that Maria Hendrickson had been poisoned by her husband, either with or without the connivance of his family. Suicide was unthinkable for numberless reasons. But the doctors couldn't find the poison. Evidences of it were there, but the substance itself, the active agent, eluded them. This was upper New York State, nearly eighty years ago, and chemical analysis was young.</p>
				<p>For two weeks, Dr. James H. Salisbury, in charge of the State Laboratory, labored to produce satisfactory chemical evidence, and failed. He soaked his gruesome relics in alcohol, distilled, evaporated, filtered, redistilled-testing for prussic acid, for arsenic, for mineral poisons and acids—and could find nothing. John Hendrickson at least knew what he was talking about when he said that they would not find arsenic.</p>
				<p>Arsenic is the traditional poison of murderers, has been their accepted tool in seven out of ten cases, from the Borgias to Mrs. Maybrick. Everybody knows it. John Hendrickson knew it. But he hadn't used it. Dr. Salisbury couldn't find what he had used. He tested for morphine, strychnine, and so on, through the list of familiar poisons, and discovered none of them.</p>
				<p>There was no one to tell him that John Hendrickson had bought an ounce vial of aconite.</p>
				<p>The hearing before the coroner's jury had been postponed from day to day in the hope of conclusive results from these tests, until, at the end of a fortnight, Dr. Salisbury was obliged to report that death had been caused by the action of some unidentified narcotic, acrid, or irritant poison. He added that he was then testing for aconite, a little known poison, and that his results so far indicated the presence of aconitine, its active principle. He must test further before he could swear to what he had found. It was a wise precaution, for aconite is one of the most subtle, as well as one of the most deadly, poisons known to man.</p>
				<p>Aconite is derived from the plant commonly known as monkshood or blue rocket, which makes an effective mass of color in so many American gardens. Every part of it is poisonous. One sixtieth of a grain of aconitine, three grains of the extract of aconite, or twenty-five drops of the tincture of aconite will cause death in anywhere from eight minutes to three hours. Aconitine and pseudo-aconitine are among the most deadly poisons known, and the chemical tests for these substances are still far from satis-factory. The symptoms of poisoning by aconite are dis-tressing, and there is no need to detail them here, with one exception. It is said by a standard textbook on toxicology that &quot;the mental faculties are commonly retained to the last.&quot; If anything could possibly add to the horror of that scene in the attic of the Hendrickson house, this statement would suffice. Through all her long agony, Maria Hendrickson must have known that she had been murdered.</p>
				<p>How John Hendrickson determined upon the use of aconite has never been satisfactorily explained. He had first decided on prussic acid but had been unable to get it. The defense made much of the unlikelihood of an uneducated young countryman ever having heard of aconite, much less having knowledge of its deadly properties. On the other hand, it may be questioned whether the poisonous properties of a common plant would not be far better known to a country boy than to one town bred. But, even granting that it was not a part of his general knowledge, another explanation offers itself. One of the homeopathic remedies that Dr. Springsteed prescribed for Maria contained aconite, though in quantities so small that —as the physician testified—it would not have killed her if she had taken all he had ever given in one dose. But John Hendrickson was accustomed to call at the doctor's office in Albany to get these medicines. Is it not possible that Dr. Springsteed once made some casual remark, as he measured out the tincture in minims, to the effect that a drug so beneficial in small quantities would be fatal in large ones?</p>
				<p>There was a sensation in the courtroom when W. G. Burroughs, Albany druggist, testified that during Inauguration Week he had sold six pennyworth of aconite, an ounce vial, to a young countryman whose description tallied recognizably with that of John Hendrickson.</p>
				<p>That week, Dr. Salisbury's continued tests satisfied him definitely that aconite was in the viscera of Maria Hen-drickson.</p>
				<p>John Hendrickson was put on trial for his life in June, 1853. He was brought into court, &quot;a young man about twenty-one years of age, upwards of five feet ten inches in height, well and heavily built, and of a generally fine appearance.&quot; &quot;His demeanour,&quot; the contemporary account has it, &quot;was calm and self possessed.&quot; He pleaded not guilty.</p>
				<p>For the personalities concerned, Albany County seethed with excitement. &quot;Quite a number of ladies were present among the spectators.&quot; But it was the unusual medical testimony that attracted the widest attention, for which it is chiefly remembered now. It is probably one of the earliest known examples of aconite poisoning outside of the Orient (where aconite is commonly used for this purpose); and is, as far as the writer knows, the first recorded in America. The case of Hendrickson antedated that of Dr. Pritchard, who dispatched his victim in 1865; and that of the famous Dr. Lamson, who was hanged in 1882, both of these being English cases.</p>
				<p>The Hendrickson case aroused the most intense and widespread interest. The Hendricksons do not seem to have been a family of any consequence themselves, but they were well connected. Unmistakably, one gets the im-pression, from the evidence given in the trial, that the witnesses knew Hendrickson to be guilty, but that they did not want him to hang for it. His family and relatives perjured themselves crassly and openly. The neighbors contented themselves with being unable to remember. They hedged. Again and again, the attorney general was infuriated to have witnesses evade questions to which they had given explicit answers before the Grand Jury. There is some indication that there was a popular fear, groundless in fact, that a verdict against John Hendrickson would involve his whole family in a charge of complicity. In any event, it was a hard-fought trial.</p>
				<p>Separately and together, the Hendricksons swore that, like the monkeys in the proverb, they had seen nothing, heard nothing, said nothing-until they had responded to John's call at three in the morning. The Hendricksons, in fact, did everything to dovetail the action of their story, but they forgot to supply their lines. None of them remembered that anything was said by anybody upon the discovery of Maria's death. It may have been the one truth in their testimony. At whatever hour they had crowded into that little attic room, one can picture the guilty terror on their faces, and the stricken silence of fear. But the very discretion they showed in keeping silent betrayed them in the end; as the empty house, which should have been her safeguard, was later to betray Lizzie Borden.</p>
				<p>Judge Marvin, speaking for himself and his two as-sociates, reminded the jury that the tracks of a horse in a plowed field were good circumstantial evidence that a horse had been there. The jury stayed out nearly twenty-four hours, but they came back with the one word:</p>
				<p>GUILTY!</p>
				<p>And on Friday, the 26th of August, John Hendrickson was hanged.</p>

				<head type="chapter">THE MURDER THAT LED TO FAME</head>
				<p>FEW OF US would be likely to point to murder as a road to success, but there is at least one instance on record in which a man shot down his enemy in the coldest of blood and then stepped across the dead body straight into the arms of fame.</p>
				<p>Murderer he undoubtedly was, but within five years of his crime he was also to be a major general in the United States army, and within ten years the American Minister to Spain.</p>
				<p>The rewards of life are sometimes eccentric, but they are apt to strike some sort of a balance in the long run and, in 1914, this murderer-general-diplomat died poor and alone in New York City, knowing that he must face in the Court of Last Resort the man he had killed and the woman whose heart he had broken.!</p>
				<p>On the morning of February 25, 1859, Daniel E. Sickles, Member of Congress from the Third District of New York, sat at the breakfast table in his house on Lafayette Square, just across from the White House. His face was gray and worn, the deep black circles under his eyes giving evidence of a sleepless night. Before him was an untasted cup of coffee, and propped against the coffee cup was an open letter. The letter had been slipped into his hand by an unknown man as Sickles was leaving the New Willard Hotel after a dance the night before; and it was signed by three initials that were strange to him. It concerned Sickles' wife, Teresa.</p>
				<p>Sickles thought of Teresa as she had been last night, as she had been during the seven years of their marriage, and the lines around his mouth tightened. His career and his wife the career came first—were the two great passions of his life.</p>
				<p>Teresa Sickles, born Teresa Bagioli, was the daughter of a New York music teacher. At the time this story opens she was twenty-three years old, eleven years younger than her husband, to whom she had been married since she was sixteen. Teresa was a fascinating person, for, with her masses of black hair, her animated dark eyes, and her rich color, she had all the vivacity and charm that are so often the portion of the daughters of southern Europe. Sickles adored her. He remembered now, as a moan forced itself through his pallid lips, how she had shone and sparkled in the brilliant drawing rooms of London during the time that he was secretary to the American Legation. He had been so proud of her. Teresa was not only a beloved wife; she was a very tangible asset to a man who was as proud and as ambitious as Lucifer, and who felt that he had within himself the power to achieve his ambi-tion.</p>
				<p>Sickles' hand shook as he reached for the letter before him, noting as he did so how his fair hair and blue eyes were reflected in the shining silver of the coffee urn. Yes, he and Teresa were excellent foils. She dark, he fair; she pliable, he determined. Sickles reread the letter for the hundredth time.</p>
				<p>This letter, the origin of which has never become known, was addressed in a curious, sprawling hand and was enclosed in a cheap envelope. It was the forerunner of tragedy, and read:</p>
				<p>Washington, Feb. 24th, 1859.</p>
				<p>Hon. Daniel Sickles:</p>
				<p>Dear Sir: With deep regret I inclose to your address these few lines, but an indispensible duty compels me to do so, seeing that you are greatly imposed upon.</p>
				<p>There is a fellow, I may say, for he is not a gentleman, by any means, by the name of Philip Barton Key &amp; I believe the district attorney who rents a house of a negro man by the name of Jno. A. Gray situated on 15th Street bt'w'n K and L Streets for no other purpose than to meet your wife Mrs Sickles, he hangs a string out of the window as a signal to her that he is in and leaves the door unfastened and she walks in and sir I do assure you</p>
				<p>With these few lines I leave the rest to you to imagine.</p>
				<p>Most Respfly</p>
				<p>Your friend R. P. G.</p>
				<p>In spite of its shabby exterior, in spite of its illiteracy, and in spite of its anonymity, Sickles felt with a sick pang that the letter told the truth, and the truth was torture to him. He was not sentimental, but he was insanely vain; and it was not only his wife's infidelity, but her infidelity with this particular man that cut him to the very marrow. Sickles hated Key, and he had watched Teresa's growing admiration for him with a distaste that he had made no effort to conceal.</p>
				<p>Sickles hated Key because he envied him.</p>
				<p>Philip Barton Key, United States District Attorney, was about forty-two years old in 1859. Of a Virginia family, his father, Francis Scott Key, was the author of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Philip Key was not particularly handsome, but he was six feet tall, of distinguished appearance and excellent family. He was a born aristocrat and a notorious philanderer. His conquests were legion. Sickles had noticed some time before that Key had been paying Teresa marked attention, and he had remonstrated with her, forbidding her to see Key alone. More than that he dared not do, for Key was an important man, and Sickles had his career to consider.</p>
				<p>Sickles had fought his way up from the bottom, having started his life as a journeyman printer. Key was to the manor born. The district attorney had been rather a frequent guest at the Sickles' house. His position in Washington opened all doors to him. Sickles had not been able to avoid him, for to shut his own door might have injured that most precious of all possessions-his future.</p>
				<p>Sickles rose from the table, put the letter in his pocket, and began to pace the room with quick, nervous strides. As he walked, his anger grew until he shook with fury. An inner conviction told him that what he had read was true, but his common sense taught him that he must know beyond all possible question before he could take action. And, even then, what action could he take? A divorce meant scandal, and scandal might mean social ruin. Likewise, there was Laura, his daughter, then a child of five. She was to be considered.</p>
				<p>Daniel E. Sickles put on his hat and coat and left the house on foot. No carriage that morning. Obviously, the first place to go was Fifteenth Street. At that time, Fifteenth Street was a distinctly down-at-the-heel section of the city, inhabited chiefly by Negroes and &quot;poor whites.&quot; As Sickles strode past the dingy houses along the unpaved, muddy sidewalk, the very out-at-elbows atmosphere of the street seemed to add to his humiliation. It was so utterly sordid. Moreover, he was too well dressed for the neighborhood, and he realized that too much questioning would excite the gossip he was most anxious to avoid. What he was looking for was a house with closed blinds. And then—he saw it! In the middle of the block, on the left-hand side of the way, fronting on the sidewalk and with a yard running back from the rear, it stood before him. Sickles hesitated. Next door, a slatternly woman was sweeping down her front steps. Sickles, unable to control his impatience, raised his hat and spoke to her, aware of the tremor in his voice and hating himself for it.</p>
				<p>&quot;I'm sorry to trouble you, madam, but do you know who owns the house next door to you, the one that is evidently closed?&quot;</p>
				<p>The woman looked at him slyly. &quot;Yes, I knows. A nigger man named Grey owns thet 'air house. And it 'tain't closed neither.&quot;</p>
				<p>Sickles drew in his breath sharply. &quot;Why do you say the house isn't closed? It looks closed. Who goes there?&quot; Again that sly, leering smile. &quot;I know that Mr. Key, the District Attorney, rents the house from the nigger .. an' I've seen him go there ... an' he ain't the only one.&quot;</p>
				<p>It was coming now. He knew it. &quot;Do you know-who else, besides Mr. Key, uses the house?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;A woman.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;What woman?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; and she turned away to her sweeping.</p>
				<p>Sickles wiped the sweat from his forehead and from the palms of his hands. There was still a chance. The woman might not be Teresa.</p>
				<p>All that morning, in his office at the Capitol, Sickles turned the matter over and over, trying to come to some conclusion that would bring him relief. It might be better to drop the whole affair. But, no-he could not live under the load of suspicion he was carrying. Better to know the worst. He must go through with it. On the other hand, he could not go back to Fifteenth Street himself. He might be recognized. He might have been recognized today even. Moreover, in his excited state, his nerves would not stand the strain of a personal investigation. Casting about for a safe confidant, Sickles hit upon one Wooldridge, a government employee, who had been his clerk during the previous session. Wooldridge was Sickles' loyal follower. He was lame, and he was not any too bright mentally, but that might even be an advantage. In any event, he could be trusted. So Sickles sent Wooldridge a message.</p>
				<p>The two men met at one o'clock in the rear of the Speaker's chair in the House of Representatives. Wool-dridge's own account of the interview can hardly be improved upon, especially since it shows Sickles for the first but not for the last time at an emotional pitch which passed the point of control. Wooldridge later testified:</p>
				<p>&quot;Mr. Sickles said, as he approached me, taking a letter out of his pocket, 'George, I want to speak to you on a painful matter. Last night I received this letter.' Mr. Sickles then read all but the last two lines, burst into tears, and handed me the letter. Before I opened it, he said that he usually threw anonymous letters aside, but that as in this case the facts could be proved or disproved so easily, he thought he would investigate it. He further said, 'My hope is that this is not my wife, but some other woman. As my friend, you will go there and see whether it is or not.' He was very much excited, so much so that he put his hands to his head, and sobbed in the lobby of the House of Representatives. He rushed from the sofa on which he was sitting, and went into another room, in a corner. He said, 'Get a carriage. We'll go there, and I'll show you the house.' I called a carriage, and he showed me Grey's house. I left him at the Treasury building. During the ride, I said that I would make the examination. I made up my mind to go and take a room in the vicinity of the house, and see whether it was Mrs. Sickles or not.&quot; </p>
				<p>t is a remarkable picture: the furtive meeting behind the Speaker's chair; the tears, the sofa, the hysteria, the essential unmanliness of the scene; the insignificant clerk swelling with importance at being raised to the dignity of a Paul Pry; the sniveling in &quot;the iobby of the House of Representatives,&quot; and all the rest of it is as vivid as it is disgusting. Public mawkishness had yet to evolve a hero out of these distressingly unheroic materials.</p>
				<p>Wooldridge's plan was perfectly sound, and he proceeded to put it into effect without delay. Within an hour, he had rented a room and got to work.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, in spite of his overwrought condition, Sickles had his work to do. He was scheduled to address the House, that afternoon of Friday, on the Navy bill, and though life might lie in ruins at his feet his duty was clear. He spoke at length and spoke well, forcing his mind away from the problem that was tormenting him.</p>
				<p>That evening, at home in the house on Lafayette Square, Sickles avoided his wife. He pleaded work and had some food sent into his study. We shall never know whether Teresa felt the cold wind of the approaching storm, but we do know that it was to be her last night of peace on earth.</p>
				<p>Sometime during the evening, Wooldridge called at the house with his first report. It contained little, but that little was of immense significance. The veiled woman had been to the house on Fifteenth Street the day before, Thursday, in the afternoon. Sickles relaxed, with a great, gasping sigh of relief. It just so happened that he could account for nearly every minute of Teresa's time on Thurs-day. It was not she! Still, to make doubly sure, he instructed Wooldridge to go back to his rented room, check his report, and, further, to get the most minute description possible of the various costumes in which the mysterious woman had been seen. Wooldridge went, and Sickles returned to the revision and correction of his speech on the Navy bill. A load had been lifted.</p>
				<p>The next day, Saturday, Sickles spent in the seclusion of his office at the Capitol. He was still on edge and ap-prehensive. He waited for Wooldridge to reassure him positively.</p>
				<p>At four in the afternoon, Wooldridge came, and ten minutes later Daniel E. Sickles was a broken man.</p>
				<p>In checking his earlier report, Wooldridge had discovered that the visitor to the house on Fifteenth Street had been there on Wednesday, and not on Thursday after-noon, as he had first reported. And Sickles knew that on Wednesday afternoon Teresa had been, supposedly, walking on Pennsylvania Avenue with the small Laura. It had been against his wishes, but she had gone. Further, Wooldridge now brought detailed descriptions of several dresses that the veiled woman had worn-the watchful eyes of the neighbors had lost nothing—and Sickles could not escape the sick realization that every one of those dresses had its exact counterpart in Teresa's big mahogany wardrobe. There was a favorite black-and-white tartan, a black velvet cloak trimmed with lace that they had bought together in Paris, a black velvet shawl with a fashionably long fringe, a little beaver hat trimmed with velvet, and others. He knew them all. There could be no further question.</p>
				<p>It is improbable that Sickles determined on murder at this time. The man's mind was a curious mixture of am-bition, pride, wounded vanity, outraged affection, and sheer hysteria. Which one of these would be uppermost during a crisis would be impossible to predict. Half a dozen possible courses were open to him, and at this juncture it is quite certain that the man had not made his choice. Indeed, from this point on, Sickles' power of choosing for himself or of acting or thinking rationally seems to have completely deserted him.</p>
				<p>Wooldridge took his leave, and Sickles left the Capitol for Lafayette Square, arriving there just before six o'clock. It was observed by the servants that his manner was strange, and that there was some &quot;unhappy feeling&quot; between husband and wife. Mrs. Sickles dined alone. Sickles had food sent to his bedroom. By this time Teresa was undoubtedly alarmed. Her conscience was uneasy. It was all too evident that trouble was brewing and that she was implicated. Unable to stand the suspense, immediately after her own meal Teresa Sickles went to their joint bedroom and confronted her husband.</p>
				<p>Precisely what occurred between husband and wife on that evening of Saturday, February 26th, will never be known, but from the evidence given at the trial it is possible to reconstruct the scene in part. A contemporary account says:</p>
				<p>&quot;At first, she strongly denied her guilt; but when asked by her husband whether on the previous Wednesday [sic.] afternoon she had not entered the house on Fifteenth Street, in a certain particular dress, she was overcome by her feeling and exclaiming, I am betrayed and lost!' swooned away.&quot;</p>
				<p>This may or may not be accurate. It is somewhat difficult to know just how the early chronicler became apprised of these intimate details, although, a little later on, there was to be little enough left to the imagination. Some definite facts are, however, known to us.</p>
				<p>In the first place, the door of the Sickles' bedroom was partly open. This was not chance, as will appear later, but a calculated move on the part of Sickles to forestall any assertion of Teresa's that he had used violence in the process of extracting the confession he intended to have. The man is a most amazing mixture of hysteria and caution. Alternately we find him whimpering with self-pity and using a sledge hammer to crush a moth. Even his strength is the strength of weakness.</p>
				<p>Sickles was cool enough to leave the door open. The house was at high tension. The servants listened. At first, the voices coming from the bedroom on the second floor were loud and angry. This was followed by a period of quiet. Then came a burst of hysterical sobbing in which both voices joined. Finally, the door was fung wide, and Mr. Sickles called for Bridget Duffy, Mrs. Sickles' maid, and for Miss Ridgeley, the resident governess. The women came. They found Sickles, his eyes red and swollen, standing near a small desk. At the desk sat Mrs. Sickles, her face in her hands, sobbing. As Bridget and Miss Ridgeley came into the room, Teresa Sickles struggled to control her tears. As she wiped her eyes, she asked in a broken voice that they sign, as witnesses, a document she had just written. Observe that she made the re-quest, not Sickles. Clearly, Teresa was acting under orders. Sickles was taking no chances of being accused of coercion. And so Mrs. Sickles signed a paper that lay on the desk, and the witnesses signed after her. It was all very regular and legal and contemptible. The two women witnesses noticed that Teresa signed her maiden name—Teresa Bagioli. Evidently she felt, or had been made to feel, that it was all she had a right to now. From this moment on, it is clear that Teresa was crushed hopelessly, finally, and to her death.</p>
				<p>The witnesses departed, and the paper did not appear again for some time. It was the now famous confession, one of the most utterly tragic documents that criminal history has preserved.</p>
				<p>Little more was said or done that night. Sickles went to bed, if not to sleep. Mrs. Sickles spent the night sitting on the floor of Miss Ridgeley's room, her head resting on a chair. Whether this banishment from the family bedroom was at her own instance or on her husband's demand, no one will ever know. It was probably the former.</p>
				<p>Sunday, February 27th, was bright and clear, but on Lafayette Square the sun shone on tragedy. Teresa Sickles did not emerge from her upstairs room at all that day. One cannot but wonder whether the stricken woman anticipated the terrible events of that fatal Sunday. Probably not. In any case, she sent no word of warning. It is probable enough that when her husband left her on the night before, he had expressed no intention other than that of divorce. Even the divorce one is left to deduce from the confession. So that what happened at two o'clock that day must have come to Teresa like a thunderbolt.</p>
				<p>Sickles went downstairs at about half-past eight. Kindly Bridget Duffy, who met him on the way, says that, &quot;He held his face in his hands and was crying and sobbing and in great trouble. I commenced crying too.&quot; One can at least be certain that Bridget's tears were sincere and not a carefully calculated exhibition. Even earlier than this, however, Sickles had felt the need of advice and consolation and had sent a message, by whom it is not known, to a Mr. Butterworth, an old New York friend, to come to him at once. Mr. Butterworth was waiting for Sickles in the study when he came down, and later in the morning they were joined by the lame clerk, Wooldridge, whose initial attempt at spying had been so successful. Exactly what passed, it is impossible to know, for the lengthy conversation was largely confined to Butterworth and Sickles, who spoke in lowered tones, and neither of whom was ever called to the stand. (That Butterworth, as heavily implicated as he was, was not called as a witness is only one of the astounding points arising in the course of the trial.) Wooldridge did testify, however, and it is from his account that we are able to get some idea of the situation.</p>
				<p>Faced with the possibilities provoked by various courses of action, Sickles was unable to make up his mind what to do. He wanted counsel. Apparently, at the outset, Butterworth advised prudence, for Wooldridge overheard him say, &quot;Only ourselves know of this.&quot; He was wrong, and doubtless knew it. The whole city was well aware of the affair between Key and Teresa Sickles and had been for months past. The husband was, as usual, the last to know. That Sickles appreciated this is shown by his reply, &quot;The whole town knows of it! What would you do?&quot; This was certainly Butterworth's opportunity to advocate sanity, but he made the stupid and fatal error of saying, &quot;As a man of honor, I have no advice to give you.&quot; If Butterworth had had a higher sense of honor, and considerably more ordinary common sense, a life might have been saved—perhaps two lives.</p>
				<p>At this point in their conversation something happened that really determined the outcome of the whole affair. The climax came swiftly.</p>
				<p>Hours had been spent in talk, and it was now nearly two in the afternoon. Butterworth had delivered his last speech as he and Sickles stood looking out of the window that faced on the Square.</p>
				<p>As the last words were spoken, Key walked by the house, looked smilingly towards the upper windows, and waved his handkerchief with a peculiar firting gesture. That was enough.</p>
				<p>Sickles and Butterworth looked at each other, turned and left the room. Wooldridge, happily innocent of trouble, was amusing himself with stereopticon views. It was a quaint pastime, under the circumstances. Though he too was near the window, he did not see anyone leave the house by the front entrance, so that Sickles and Butter-worth must have departed via the kitchen door.</p>
				<p>Once they were outside the house, Butterworth hurried on ahead and, catching up with Key, just about where the Belasco Theater is today, detained him for a minute in talk. This gave Sickles the chance for a direct frontal attack. As Butterworth stepped back, Sickles, white and grim, advanced upon Key with:</p>
				<p>&quot;Key, you scoundrel, you have dishonored my home! You must die!&quot;</p>
				<p>Key, realizing instantly that his moment was upon him, raised his hand to his breast as if to draw a weapon. Fate was against him. He had gone armed for weeks, doubtless in anticipation of just such an emergency, but today, of all days, he was unarmed. Sickles drew a revolver from the pocket of his overcoat and fired point-blank. The shot took effect, but not mortally. Key grappled with his adversary. Sickles threw him off, and Key retreated, crying out, &quot;Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't murder me!&quot; Sickles said nothing but, advancing to within ten feet of Key, fired again. Key fell to the gutter. Once more, Sickles fired, the third bullet striking close to the second. Only then did the murderer throw his smoking gun to the sidewalk and walk coolly away, accompanied by Butterworth.</p>
				<p>There were several eyewitnesses to the shooting, and Key was at once carried into the Cosmos Club, near by.</p>
				<p>In fifteen minutes he was dead. That Sunday the judgment of man had outrun the judgment of God.</p>
				<p>It will be observed that, despite his hysterical condition of the early morning, testified to by Duffy, Sickles had been perfectly calm during the killing. Evidently, the opportunity for action brought him some measure of relief. This was not to last.</p>
				<p>Sickles and Butterworth returned to the Sickles house, and the police were notified. In an hour Washington was agog. Here was a scandal in high life indeed! The United States District Attorney shot down in cold blood by the Congressman from New York! Captain Goddard, chief of police, came to the Sickles house, accompanied by Mayor Berrit and others. Before their advent, however, a strange scene took place which throws an interesting light on Sickles' state of mind, and which was an important factor in the trial that followed. Mr. Robert J. Walker, a Washington man and a friend of Sickles, came to the house as soon as he got word of the shooting. Mr. Walker's account of his interview with Sickles is important.</p>
				<p>&quot;It was either three or twenty minutes after three o'clock that I saw him in his own house on the afternoon of that day, in the back room of the first story. As he came in, his manner appeared excited. There was something strange and unusual about it. His voice was somewhat different from the manner in which I had usually heard him speak. He advanced and took me by the hand. I think he then said, 'A thousand thanks for coming to see me under these circumstances.' He had scarcely repeated these words before I saw a great change in his appearance.</p>
				<p>He became very much convulsed indeed. He threw himself on the sofa, covering his face with his hands. He then broke into an agony of unnatural and unearthly sounds—something like a scream, interrupted by violent sob-bing. From his convulsed appearance, he was in the act of writhing. His condition appeared to me to be very frightful, appalling me so much that I thought if it lasted much longer he must become insane. He was indulging in exclamations about dishonor having been brought to his house, his wife and child. He seemed particularly to dwell on the disgrace brought upon his child. Such an exhibition is sufficiently rare to deserve attention.&quot; </p>
				<p>Undoubtedly, Sickles was a neurotic. Undoubtedly, too, he saw at this moment his life in ruins about him. His wife was dead for him, his career ended. Rage, injured pride, and an inevitable emotional reaction all combined to make up the outburst. Mr. Walker thought that his cries were grief. They were more than that. They were utter despair, the despair of an essentially weak man who was wallowing in an excess of self-pity, and who was willing to adopt any means, no matter how ignoble, to gain sym-pathy. It has been said that these explosions of Sickles were carefully staged with a view to pleading insanity at the trial, but it is probable that they fell short of that. And in the meantime, while all this was going on, who was there to comfort the young wife, hidden away in the room upstairs, her lover dead at the hands of her husband? From now on Teresa Sickles becomes a shadow that drifts out of the story, and that was soon to drift out of life.</p>
				<p>Looking back over the years, it seems rather curious that popular sympathy should have flooded in on Sickles, as it did immediately after his arrest, on the Sunday of the murder. Doubtless it was that odd American complex that painted Harry Thaw as a knight in shining armor. For every American who would &quot;rather be right than President&quot; there seem to be ten who would rather be maudlin. At any rate, Sickles became the hero of the hour.</p>
				<p>The trial was set for April 4th, and in the month that intervened little else was talked of in Washington. For the moment, even the burning question of slavery took second place. Sickles' cell was knee deep in flowers. Notables flocked to see him and to congratulate him-God alone knows on what.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Sickles had vanished. On an evening not long after the shooting, a heavily veiled figure slipped out of the house on Lafayette Square and into a closed carriage. Teresa Bagioli was going back to her father's house in New York. Even the consolation of her child was denied her. Laura remained in Washington, safe from the contaminating influence of her mother.</p>
				<p>The day of the trial arrived. It was to last for eighteen days. Sickles was represented by a large body of brilliant counsel. The state did not fare so well. The plea was Not Guilty, and the defense that Sickles was of unsound mind at the time of the shooting. In making this point, however, the defense found it expedient to paint Mrs. Sickles in the darkest colors, so that, to the spectators, it was rather a trial of Mrs. Sickles for adultery than of Daniel E.</p>
				<p>Sickles for murder. Just thirty years later, in England, Mrs. Maybrick was engulfed by a like whirlpool of moral indignation. At the Washington trial, Mrs. Sickles was not represented.</p>
				<p>Sickles was almost literally the idol of the nation. His shooting of Key raised him to a peak of popularity that no one, not even himself, could possibly have predicted. It was as if every American husband, in deadly fear of being made a cuckold, resolved to cite Sickles as the shining example of what would happen if Even his desertion of Teresa was acclaimed. Her pitiable confession became public even before it was admitted as evidence —it was in the hands of the defense-and was read by eager thousands of the nasty minded. Someone, it was never known who, gave it to the press. The prosecution had done its best to keep the pathetic document out of court. The defense clamored for its admission. When it was finally read to the jury, each side blamed the other for its lack of good taste. This confession, which was supposed to have driven Sickles insane, but which had obviously been dictated by him, was as follows:</p>
				<p>&quot;I have been in a house on Fifteenth Street with Mr. Key. How many times I don't know. I believe the house belongs to a colored man. The house is unoccupied. I commenced going there the latter part of January. I have been in alone and with Mr. Key. I usually stayed an hour or more. There was a bed in the second story. I did what is usual for a wicked woman to do. The intimacy commenced this winter when I came from New York, in that house-an intimacy of an improper kind. Have met half a dozen times or more, at different hours of the day. On Monday of this week and on Wednesday also. Would arrange meetings when we met in the street, and at parties. Never would speak to him when Mr. Sickles was at home; because I knew he did not like me to speak to him; did not see Mr. Key for some days after I got here. He then told me he had hired the house as a place where he and I could meet. I agreed to it. Had nothing to eat or drink there. The room is warmed by a wood fire. Mr. Key generally goes frst. Have walked there together, say four times—I do not think more; was there on Wednesday last, between two and three. I went there alone. Laura was at Mrs. Hoover's. Mr. Key took and left her there at my request. From there I went to Fifteenth Street to meet Mr. Key; from there to the milk woman's. Immediately Mr. Key left Laura at Mrs. Hoover's, I met him in Fifteenth Street. I went in by the back gate. I went into the same bedroom, and there an improper interview was had. I undressed myself. Mr. Key undressed also. This occurred on Wednesday, 23rd of February, 1859. Mr. Key has kissed me in this house [sic: on Lafayette Square] a number of times. I do not deny that we have had connection in this house, a year ago, in the parlour, on the sofa. Mr. Sickles was sometimes out of town, and sometimes at the Capitol. I think the intimacy commenced in April or May, 1858. I did not think it safe to meet him in this house, because there are servants who might suspect something. As a general thing I have worn a black and white woolen plaid dress, and beaver hat trimmed with black velvet. I have worn a black silk dress there also, also a plaid silk dress, a black velvet cloak trimmed with lace, a black velvet shawl trimmed with fringe. On Wednesday 1 either had on my brown dress, or black and white woolen dress, beaver hat and velvet shawl. I arranged with Mr. Key to go in the back way, after leaving Laura at Mrs. Hoover's. He met me at Mr. Douglas'. The arrangement to go in the back way was either made in the street or at Mr. Douglas', as we would be less likely to be seen. The house is in Fifteenth Street, between K and L streets, on the left hand side of the way; arranged the interview for Wednesday in the street, I think on Monday. I went in the front door, it was open, occupied the same room, undressed myself, and he also; went to bed together. Mr. Key has ridden in Mr. Sickles' carriage, and has called at his house without Mr. Sickles' knowledge, and after my having been told not to invite him to do so, and against Mr. Sickles' repeated requests.</p>
				<p>&quot;Teresa Bagioli.</p>
				<p>&quot;This is a true statement, written by myself, without any inducement held out by Mr. Sickles of forgiveness or reward, and without any menace from him. This I have written with my bedroom door open, and my maid and child in the adjoining room, at half past eight o'clock in the evening. Miss Ridgeley is in the house within call.</p>
				<p>&quot;Teresa Bagioli.</p>
				<p>&quot;Lafayette Square, Washington D. C., Feb. 26th, 1859</p>
				<p>&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Pendleton dined here two weeks ago last Thursday, with a large party. Mr. Key was also here, her brother, and at my suggestion he was invited, because he lived in the same house, and also he had invited Mr. Sickles to dine with him, and Mr. Sickles wished to invite all those from whom he had received invitations; and Mr. Sickles said, 'Do as you please.'</p>
				<p>&quot;Teresa Bagioli.&quot;</p>
				<p>Whatever one may think of the woman who made this confession, there can be only one opinion of the man who forced it from her. Its morbid repetition and insistence on unnecessary detail; its crucifixion of Teresa, and its adula-tion, implied, of Sickles himself; these and more stamp it as Sickles' work and damn him in the stamping. Not only does it smack of the lawyer, but it reads far more like the answers of a witness undergoing a searching cross-examination than like a true confession. Sickles was sane enough to know exactly what he wanted to get on paper an evidence for a divorce, at any rate.</p>
				<p>At the outset of the trial, Sickles had been, at least outwardly, composed, and had managed with some success to maintain his dignity. Before long, however, z the sickening mass of intimate detail began to come out under cross-examination, he wilted. Several times he left the room in tears. The judge was on his side. The jury was with him; and the public hung on his every word. No effort was spared by the defense to arouse sympathy.</p>
				<p>On the sixteenth day of the trial, an amusing and typical incident took place. Among the many letters received by counsel on both sides, from all parts of the country, was one addressed to Mr. Brady, one of the attorneys for the defense. It came from a lady, the term is used ad-visedly, who signed herself in Greek characters, Olympia Aiken, which was, in all probability, not her name. Olympia described herself as &quot;one of the order of frailty —one of the simple waiters for the wave of some masculine pocket handkerchief.&quot; Her letter was postmarked, West Randolph, Vermont (my own map shows only Randolph, East Randolph, and Randolph Center), and directed Mr. Brady's attention to the following quotation from a pamphlet entitled White Lies.</p>
				<p>&quot;I'd have no wasps around my honey. If my wife took a lover, I would not lecture the woman—what's the use? I'd kill the man, then and there. I'd kill him indoors or out. I'd kill him as I would a snake. If she took another, I'd send him after the first, and so on, till one killed me.&quot; Counsel for the defense were not pleased with this effusion. They resented a statement that so plainly reflected their own attitude.</p>
				<p>Finally, on the twentieth day, the case was given to the jury. That palladium of our rights deliberated for seventy minutes, and then brought in a verdict of Not Guilty. The courtroom rang with cheers. Daniel E. Sickles was adjudged innocent.</p>
				<p>There followed a curious aftermath. Within six months of the trial, Sickles came close to losing the enormous popularity the affair had won for him, and this because he did the one decent thing that he had done so far. He forgave his wife. At this there was a real storm of disapproval, so great a storm, in fact, that Sickles came out with a public answer to his critics. As this answer is a further sidelight on the man, and as it is as remarkable a document, in its way, as the confession, it is worth quoting.</p>
				<p>&quot;I am not aware of any statute or code of morals which makes it infamous to forgive a woman; nor is it usual to make our domestic life a subject of consultation with friends, no matter how near and dear to us. And I cannot allow even all the world combined to dictate to me the repudiation of my wife, when I think it right to forgive her and restore her to my confidence and protection.</p>
				<p>&quot;If I ever failed to comprehend the utterly desolate position of an offending though penitent woman-the hopeless figure, with its dark possibilities of danger, to which she is doomed when proscribed an outcast—1 can now see plainly enough in the almost universal howl of denunciation with which she is followed to my threshold, the misery and peril from which I have rescued the mother of my child.</p>
				<p>&quot;And although it is very sad for me to incur the blame of friends and the reproaches of many wise and good people, I shall strive to prove to all who may have any interest in me that if I am the first man who has ventured to say to the world that an erring wife and mother may be forgiven and redeemed, in spite of all the obstacles in my path, the good results of this example shall entitle it to the imitation of the generous and the commendation of the just.&quot;</p>
				<p>That was Daniel all over! Self-righteous to the last!</p>
				<p>It was all very fine indeed, albeit a trifle Pecksniffian. And so Teresa Bagioli came back, back to the gloomy house on Lafayette Square with its still more gloomy memories. What went on there, how real the boasted forgiveness was, no one can know. Teresa Sickles was never seen in public again.</p>
				<p>Two years later, in 1861, the Civil War broke out. Sickles was made the colonel of a New York regiment and, within a year, rose to the rank of brigadier general. Later, he was a major general and lost a leg at Gettysburg. Still later, he was Minister to Spain.</p>
				<p>But long before that time came Teresa had died in New York. The shock, the humiliation, the long agony had been too great. At twenty-three she was a broken women. At twenty-five she was dead.</p>
				<p>The child, Laura, grew up to fling her life away in dis-sipation, and to die in poverty in a room in Brooklyn, cursing her father.</p>

				<head type="chapter">DEATH DRAWS A TRIANGLE</head>
				<p>A MURDER that involved the names of Horace Greeley, Whitelaw Reid, Henry Ward Beecher, Edwin Booth, and Daniel Frohman; that resulted in stigmatizing the sovereign state of Indiana as &quot;the Paradise of Adulterers,&quot; and in the characterization of most of the gentlemen named above as &quot;notorious free lovers&quot;; that rocked the city of New York from the Hudson to the East River— such a murder might fairly be called a cause célèbre.</p>
				<p>This is the story of that murder and of its very curious consequences.</p>
				<p>At about five o'clock on the afternoon of Thursday, November 25, 1869, a thickset man walked into what was known as the counting room of the New York Tribune. He came in from the Park Row entrance and waited quietly without attracting more than casual attention. He was seen and recognized, however, by a clerk as being one Daniel McFarland, an employee in the office of the City Assessor.</p>
				<p>At about a quarter-past five, Albert D. Richardson, a well known journalist of the day, came briskly into the counting room, went up to one of the desks there, and asked for his mail. Parenthetically, it may beremarked that the clerk at this desk was young Daniel Frohman, who is described in a contemporary account as being &quot;a decidedly good-looking young gentleman of eighteen years, with black hair; and dressed in a fashionable black suit with a wide Byron collar.&quot;</p>
				<p>Daniel Frohman turned to get Mr. Richardson his mail, and then jumped as a shot rang out behind him. Frohman about-faced in time to see Richardson stagger out of the door that led to the stairs going up to the editorial rooms, two floors above; and to observe McFarland slip out through the exit into Nassau Street.</p>
				<p>There was only the crash of the shot and the sudden disappearance of the two men. No spoken word. No out-cry. And it was some minutes before the startled occupants of the counting room realized what had happened. Then there was a stampede.</p>
				<p>Richardson, mortally wounded as he was, managed to crawl up two—some accounts say four-flights of stairs to the editorial rooms, where he collapsed on a sofa, moaning with pain but quite conscious and coherent. He had been shot through the stomach.</p>
				<p>Although by this time the entire Tribune Building was in a panic of excitement—newspapers preferring their news a little less local—a doctor was immediately sent for, and within an hour Richardson had been moved to Room 115 of the Astor House, on Broadway, just across City Hall Park.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, according to his own account, Daniel McFarland walked calmly up Center Street, after leaving the Tribune, and, &quot;feeling weak and hungry,&quot; stepped into a restaurant to partake of coffee and stew. He then walked on uptown, picking up his brother on the way, and, at about seven o'clock, checked in at the old West-moreland Hotel at Seventeenth Street and Fourth Avenue (it has only just been demolished), where he was given Room 31.</p>
				<p>But Daniel Frohman, the advertising clerk who had joined the Tribune three years before as office boy, and who was to become one of the great figures in the American theater, had not been the only witness to the murder. There had been a fellow clerk, George M. King, in the office, and King had actually seen the shot fired. Conse-quently, the police started looking for Daniel McFarland in a hurry.</p>
				<p>At ten o'clock that evening, Captain Anthony J. Allaire of the Fourth Precinct arrested McFarland in his room at the Westmoreland.</p>
				<p>It is at this point, at the very moment of arrest, that accounts begin to differ and, indeed, not only to differ, but to become completely opposed. As we shall see, there were excellent reasons for covering McFarland.</p>
				<p>At the trial, McFarland's counsel stated in his opening speech for the defense that when Captain Allaire arrested him, McFarland exclaimed, &quot;My God, it must have been me! No—it was not! Yes—it must have been me!&quot; and continued with a description of the shooting in which McFarland is quoted as saying:</p>
				<p>&quot;I saw suddenly two eyes close upon me like those of a demon! I saw a flash; heard a report. I recollect nothing more.&quot;</p>
				<p>Now the curious and interesting part of this is that nowhere in the actual testimony given at the trial is there the slightest basis for these quotations. They seem to have been sheer inventions, designed solely to support a plea of emotional insanity—beloved of the American killer!—and without any justification in fact.</p>
				<p>What actually seems to have happened was that McFarland submitted quietly to arrest, was taken at once to Room 115 at the Astor House, where Richardson identified him, and was then lodged in Captain Allaire's own room at the Fourth Precinct Station House, where he sat &quot;smoking and seemingly quite calm and unconcerned,&quot; according to the Tribune reporter who interviewed him there.</p>
				<p>McFarland must be acquitted. McFarland must be whitewashed; and to do this effectively it was necessary to blacken the other side. Precisely why all this was so essential to the political rulers of New York is the real reason for this story.</p>
				<p>McFarland, Richardson, and the woman who was the apex of the triangle were no more than the proverbial pawns who were to be used after the traditional manner. Their lives, their loves and hates, their personal tragedy, were destined to be lost sight of—or to be so distorted by malice as to bear no relation to reality—in the confusion of larger issues in which they became engulfed at five-fifteen o'clock on that fatal Thursday afternoon.</p>
				<p>The newspaper reports and the various pamphlets of the day that deal with this bloody drama are so violently partisan that it is only by checking and cross-checking, by exploring and examining, that the real truth can be known. That truth, which throws so amazing a light upon mid- Victorian New York, is the essence of this tale.</p>
				<p>Before going further into the almost incredible consequences of McFarland's act, it will be necessary to understand the events which led up to the murder.</p>
				<p>Daniel McFarland was the son of an Irish immigrant who had come to this country in 1823 and had settled in New York. At fourteen Daniel was apprenticed to a tailor, but making clothes for other men had few charms for a boy who wanted to be well dressed himself, and the next few years were roving ones of which the account is frag-mentary. Daniel McFarland went South for a time; came back and went into business with his brother, who was a harness maker in Newark; and, somewhere around 1840, gravitated to Boston, where his occupation was unknown. He must have had some ambition at this time, and he must have saved his money, for in 1848, when Daniel was twenty-eight years old, he entered Dartmouth College.</p>
				<p>At Dartmouth, McFarland seems to have specialized in chemistry, and during his third year he was made a sort of informal assistant to the professor heading that department. But McFarland was restless-he was always restless—and his third college year was his last. At the suggestion of the professor of chemistry, he went to Europe to study, stayed there a year, came back and studied for the law! He was admitted to the bar in Massachusetts but never practised. Then came another year as professor of logic and elocution-God knows how the two were coupled or even reconciled!—in Brandywine College down in Delaware; and at just about this time McFarland's further interest in any regular occupation seems to have ceased.</p>
				<p>The man was a dreamer, but without the courage or stamina to carry out his dreams. He was born for failure because he hadn't the backbone for anything else. And when a man like that fails, he turns to crime.</p>
				<p>During 1852, when McFarland was meandering through New England for no very special reason, he ran across a poor family of weavers who were living in Lowell, Massa-chusetts. Only one of the family interested McFarland, however, and that was Abby, the daughter, who was then about fourteen, an exceedingly pretty girl and one who gave the impression of having undiscovered potentialities. Mcfarland left Lowell, but he did not forget Abby Sage. Five years later, in 1857, he went back and married her.</p>
				<p>They were married, this oddly assorted pair, on December 4, 1857, when Abby was nineteen and McFarland thirty-seven. Quite aside from any other drawback, the difference in years was too great. And there were other drawbacks, profound ones.</p>
				<p>In the five years that had intervened between the meeting and the marriage, the little daughter of the weaver had grown in more than height. She had become the teacher of a little country school in Manchester, New Hampshire; and she had begun to write little pieces for the papers, pleasant, harmless little pieces about children and nature and what-not. Abby Sage was on the way to becoming an author. But McFarland told her that he had a fine law business in Madison, Wisconsin-to which he had gravitated—with twenty or thirty thousand dollars in real money, and Abby was impressed. Not that she married him for that. There is every reason to believe that she really loved her Daniel, and doubtless she was touched by the fidelity of a man who had waited for her for five years. She was to learn, however, that whatever McFarland had been during those years he had certainly not been faithful, and she was to learn-other things. She had not long to wait after the wedding.</p>
				<p>On their bridal journey, in New York, on their way to Madison, they stopped long enough to permit McFarland to borrow the remainder of their train fare. When they finally arrived at Madison, Abby discovered that the law practise, along with the twenty to thirty thousand dollars, was as mythical as buried treasure.</p>
				<p>By February of '58, two months after their marriage, they were back in New York again. Mcfarland promptly and efficiently pawned the few small articles of value that Abby had, and then sent her home to her father to wait for better times. They never came.</p>
				<p>The entire married life of the McFarlands is summarized by the first two months of their marriage. There was this difference, however: as Daniel went down, Abby went up. She refused to sink with him.</p>
				<p>McFarland seems to have taken up drinking as a profession at about the time they moved to a cottage in Brooklyn, in the autumn of 1858. Before that he was no more than an earnest amateur. Now things went from bad to worse with an interesting rapidity.</p>
				<p>It would be fruitless to follow these two through all the ups and downs—there were mighty few ups! of the next ten years, but there are some events that stand out as being, not important in themselves, but as they bear on what was to follow. The red thread of destiny can be traced as it winds in and out through apparently unimportant happenings.</p>
				<p>In 1860, the McFarlands were in Madison again, and in a desperate effort to get together enough money to keep them going Abby started giving &quot;dramatic readings,&quot; a form of terrorism that is now fortunately almost extinct. The readings were definitely successful, however, and McFarland conceived the idea of returning to New York, fitting Abby for the stage and, after her début, becoming himself an actor. This was apparently based on the not uncommon theory that if you fail at everything else you can always go on the stage. It was exactly the sort of idea that would seem like a stroke of genius to a man like McFarland, and he proceeded at once to act upon it.</p>
				<p>In June, 1861, they returned to New York, took lodgings with Mrs. Oliver, at 58 Varick Street, and started in, living on what Abby had managed to save out in Wisconsin and on what little they had made from the sale of their few sticks of furniture.</p>
				<p>Abby, her beauty more matured, her charm more engaging than ever, took what lessons she could afford from Mr. and Mrs. George Vandenhoff, who imparted the secrets of elocution to a few select pupils; and that fall and winter she managed to support the entire family-there were children by now-with her readings.</p>
				<p>Just what she read and how she read it is lost to history, but at least she did sufficiently well so that she was able to make from one to two hundred dollars a recital, and was soon being &quot;taken up by the right people.&quot; </p>
				<p>The right people, in this instance, were Mrs. Cleveland, sister of Horace Greeley, the forthright editor of the Tribune, Mrs. Calhoun, who ran a popular column of gossip and chit-chat on the same paper, and Mrs. Sinclair, wife of the Tribune's publisher. And so it was that, purely by chance, Abby McFarland found herself projected, head, neck, and heels, into a Imbune coterie, which was as placed, as marked, as definite, as final as was Tammany Hall, which it opposed. Abby's friends, her patrons, were all Tribune people. This was to prove, later, of tremendous importance. At the moment its only effect was to give her intellectual and sympathetic companionship, and to consolidate her readings at Steinway Hall, that Mecca of the mid-Victorian intelligentsia.</p>
				<p>So matters went along for a while, Abby achieving her small triumphs on the platform, and McFarland gradually drinking himself into alcoholic insanity. By the winter of '62 he was threatening suicide half the time, and murder the other half. By the spring of the following year he had struck Abby in the face.</p>
				<p>Abby told Mrs. Cleveland that she didn't think she could stand it much longer, and the Clevelands and Sinclairs, with their Tribune influence, got McFarland a job in the office of the provost marshal—which should have had a salutary effect on him but didn't.</p>
				<p>For nearly three years, until the autumn of 1866, affairs drifted along rather uneventfully, if by uneventfully one means the series of petty annoyances and minor disappointments that so often, imperceptibly but inevitably, bring life to a climax. True, during these three years the country was engulfed in the bloodiest war in its history, but for these people blood was still to shed.</p>
				<p>It was in the autumn of '66 that Abby McFarland stepped from the recital platform to the dramatic stage, for it was at this time that she got a part at the Winter Garden at $20 a week. It was Mrs. Calhoun, the Tribune columnist, who did that for her.</p>
				<p>The Winter Garden, originally Tripler Hall, was on the west side of Broadway, nearly opposite Bond Street. Built in 1850 for the debut of Jenny Lind in America, but completed too late for her to appear there, the Winter Garden was known as the largest music hall in the world, with a stage one hundred feet wide and everything else in proportion. Since 1850, it had passed through many hands and several changes of name, but in 1866 it was the Winter Garden, and under the management of no less n person than Edwin Booth, who was starring there with his own company.</p>
				<p>Little Abby McFarland, née Sage, with her golden-brown hair and her sweetly careful voice, played Nerissa there to Booth's Shylock in 1866. Her first appearance was on the evening of November 28th, and it is curious to observe how the last week of November dogged her footsteps. That week was always fatal to her. Nevertheless, the country school teacher was coming up in the world.</p>
				<p>But even the theater didn't make Abby forget the little pieces she had once written about children and animals and flowers and what-not, and so, while all this was going on, Abby was writing. Quite aside from any other consideration, she needed the money. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go very far towards keeping all of a family in food, and part of a family in liquor, and what McFarland did with the money he got from the provost marshal's office no one seemed to know. Certainly, Abby and the children never saw any of it. So Abby wrote.</p>
				<p>She wrote for the Riverside Magazine, for the Independ-ent, and for several other publications, and these cultural activities brought into her life the man who was to give her the greatest happiness and the deepest sorrow she had ever known.</p>
				<p>It was at either the Clevelands' or the Sinclairs'— accounts differ, and it is unimportant—that Abby McFarland met Albert D. Richardson. The evening she met him changed her life as definitely and as abruptly as the course of a stream changes when it has been dynamited.</p>
				<p>Richardson, a man in his early thirties and a widower with three children, was a native of New England, and a brother of the editor and owner of a religious journal in Boston. He was the secret correspondent of the Tribune in the South while the acts of secession were being passed, and the army correspondent of the Tribune in the West during the war. He was captured by the Confederates and imprisoned in both Libby and Salisbury prisons. He escaped, crossed the country, reached the Union lines, and soon afterwards wrote a book called Field, Dungeon and Escape, which went to a sale of 96,000 copies. Later, he wrote a life of General Grant. When the Union Pacific Railroad was opened, the Tribune sent him on a trip over the line, during which he met and befriended Mark Twain, who was less well known than he, and that resulted in another book, Beyond the Mississippi, which sold over 70,000. Altogether, Albert D. Richardson, forgotten as he is today, was a highly successful journalist in the 'sixties. He was a fine-looking man too, with a blond beard, a high forehead, straight nose, and sensitive mouth. His position, background, and personality were all such as to attract a woman, just as Abby's beauty, talent, and need for protection made their sure appeal.</p>
				<p>How sudden, how violent the attraction of these two was for each other it is a little difficult to estimate. Two years later, there was so much mud-slinging that today one must dig for the truth. Abby was in trouble. Life at home was becoming rapidly and increasingly impossible. She had quite enough to think about and to worry over without a love affair to complicate matters. She liked and admired Richardson, but for the moment, that was all. On his part, it is probable that any emotion he may have felt was restrained by the fact that not only was Abby the wife of another man, but that she was sufficiently harassed to make any very marked attention from him unwelcome at that time. Whatever he felt, he seems to have realized that it was wiser to wait, and kinder to be a helpful friend rather than an importunate lover. Had he not had a madman to deal with, he would have been right.</p>
				<p>Richardson's friendship for Abby manifested itself in a very practical way. He was a successful author. She was a needy beginner. He would help her to get her work pub-lished. There exists, in one of the many old pamphlets dealing with this curious case, a description that, while it is too long to quote in full, is too amusing to omit alto-gether. The scene takes place in the office of the American Publishing Company in Hartford, &quot;on a snowy afternoon in the winter of 1867.&quot; The actors are Richardson, Abby McFarland, the editors of the publishing company, and the staff artist.</p>
				<p>&quot;Mr. Richardson said briefly, as he took a chair: Mr. Bliss, this is Mrs. McFarland. She has some sheets of manuscript which she wants to have made into a book. I would like to have you examine them. I think they will sell among your customers.'</p>
				<p>&quot;Mrs. McFarland took a seat and unrolled a folio of manuscript.</p>
				<p>&quot;'Is there any poetry in it?' said Bliss. 'Poetry doesn't sell now. There's no market for it.'</p>
				<p>&quot;'I don't know. You will have to examine the manu-script,' said Mr. Richardson.</p>
				<p>&quot;'A good story will sell, I think,' said Mr. Belknap, 'if it is a good one. Let Mrs. McFarland read some of her composition.'</p>
				<p>&quot;'There ought to be plenty of woodcuts to sell a book,' said Cox, the artist.</p>
				<p>&quot;'Yes, pictures will sell a book when nothing else will,' said Mr. Bliss with the black whiskers.</p>
				<p>&quot;'The title that I think of taking for my book is Pebbles and Pearls,' said Mrs. McFarland, in a low, womanly, musical voice.</p>
				<p>&quot;'Pebbles and Pearls?' said Mr. Bliss with the sandy tuft, &quot;hasn't that been done before?'</p>
				<p>&quot;'I think not,' said Mrs. McFarland. 'It is at least original with me.'</p>
				<p>&quot;'Well, let Mrs. McFarland read some extracts from her manuscript, and then we shall be able to judge of its merit,' said Mr. Belknap, who seemed to be the Chesterfield of the firm.</p>
				<p>&quot;'Mrs. McFarland then unrolled the manuscript, and in a tone which delighted so many audiences in Jersey, read the first extract on 'Pat the News Boy?'</p>
				<p>&quot;'That wouldn't go bad with pictures,' said Cox, the artist.</p>
				<p>&quot;Well, what do you think about your book? What is it worth?' said Mr. Bliss.</p>
				<p>&quot;'Let me read further,' said Mrs. McFarland. 'I have a little poem which I would like you gentlemen to hear. Little Dan is my boy, and I have written this &quot;Little Dan.&quot;'</p>
				<p>&quot;Having read this poem, the artist interrupted. 'I can make a nice picture of Little Dan, I think.' [In this poem the lady lovingly described her child.]</p>
				<p>&quot;'Have you any other nice, short sketches?' said Mr. Belknap to Mrs. McFarland.</p>
				<p>&quot;The lady read a short fairy tale, with a singular charm in her voice. It was about &quot;The Voyagers.' The reading of this manuscript being concluded, the different members of the firm began to look at each other inquiringly, not knowing exactly what to answer.</p>
				<p>&quot;Mrs. McFarland waited a while with the manuscript in her hands, for she had children to support, and bread must be earned for them somehow. Mr. Richardson sat quiet and collected, with sympathy for the fair authoress. Mr. Belknap finally said,</p>
				<p>&quot;'Will you be kind enough to read some more, Mrs. McFarland?'</p>
				<p>&quot;'Yes,' said Mr. Bliss. 'Be kind enough to read some more of the poems, if you please, and then we shall be better able to decide upon the matter.'</p>
				<p>&quot;Mrs. McFarland then read two poems, the first being a loving description of her two children, described only as a mother could describe them, and headed 'In the Twilight.' The second poem was calculated to interest those who had dear ones at sea and was entitled 'The Sailor's Wife.'</p>
				<p>&quot;'I guess we'll take that book,' said Mr. Bliss, 'and we'll print it too. It's not bad.'</p>
				<p>&quot;Mrs. McFarland was satisfied and seemed much relieved at the decision of the American Publishing Company. The book sold well, and it is understood that the lady realized about $500 as her share of the profits.&quot; </p>
				<p>As a picture of publishing in 1867, one doubts whether this has ever been equaled. Certainly, it has never been surpassed. As a matter of fact, Abby's literary output was neither better nor worse than the average run. Indeed, its sentimental mediocrity is common to the vaporings of the hack writer in every day and age.</p>
				<p>There were other papers and more books, for by now Abby was writing not only for the Riverside Magazine and the Independent, but for the Round Table and even for the Atlantic Monthly. There were articles in the New York Tribune too, &quot;Westward to the Indies&quot; and &quot;East-ward to the Indies,&quot; &quot;Fairy Stories for Children,&quot; &quot;Tales from Shakespeare and the Old English Poets,&quot; and &quot;The Hamlets of the Stage,&quot; as was only fitting for one who had played with Booth. It was all very genteel, elegant even. And, withal, it is rather pathetic. Abby did her best, one may be sure; and was properly proud of her success as an &quot;authoress.&quot; Richardson helped.</p>
				<p>It was November of 1866 when Abby went on the Winter Garden stage, and the next month her landlady requested her to move, saying that she &quot;could not possibly have an actress in the house.&quot; So Abby moved, husband and two children with her, to 86 Amity Street; and the next month, January, 1867, moved again to number 72, in the same street. Here she took &quot;the back parlor and extension room,&quot; and all four of them crowded in. Not much space for a tired actress and a working writer.</p>
				<p>In February the train was fired that ultimately blew up the ship. Richardson decided to give up his rooms and move into the same house with the McFarlands. And not only into the same house, but into the next room to theirs. It was either unbelievably indiscreet or incredibly innocent. There is not the slightest evidence that they were having what is known as &quot;an affair.&quot; If he loved her or she him, nothing had been said to indicate it. In all probability Richardson was in love with Abby by now, but he had not told her so. It was a mad thing to do -this move. It gave the gossips and scandalmongers of two years later just the chance they were looking for, and it gave Mcfarland, even at that moment, an opportunity to translate alcoholic insanity into jealous mania. True, he had no excuse, no real reason, but the jealous man or woman needs none.</p>
				<p>One can follow, after a fumbling fashion, the devious involutions of McFarland's sick mind. He was a psychopathic case. The man was a drunken failure and knew it with all the maudlin self-pity of his kind. Undoubtedly, he interpreted Abby's small successes-her part at the Winter Garden, her writing, her friendship with the Clevelands and the Sinclairs, in whose drawing rooms he had no place —as a reflection on him. The man was eaten up with envy. He was totally unable to face the fact that he was a drunkard and a brute; that he was utterly dis-honest, as he was; that he was looked upon with contemptuous dislike by people with whom he might have associated; and that all these things were entirely his own fault and that of no one else. All that he had was the realization of abject failure, and the imperative impulse to blame someone else for it. The type is by no means un-usual.</p>
				<p>With Richardson and the McFarlands in the same house, it was only natural that Abby and Albert should see something of one another. McFarland was out most of the day. He now had a job in the city assessor's office, where he was able to turn a dishonest penny by blackmailing tax dodgers. Abby ran in to consult Richardson about whatever manuscript she was working on, and he would knock at her door with whatever of interest he had to offer. No more than that. It is important to stress the fact because of later accusations, and if the point seems unduly labored it is only because the later smoke screen was so dense that it implied a conflagration that simply was not there.</p>
				<p>McFarland did his best to drown his jealousy in drink, but that was like trying to put out a fire with oil. Scene followed scene, until finally, on the night of February 19th, Richardson lay awake for hours listening to the drunken recriminations of McFarland in the next room, which at last rose to such a pitch that he wondered whether he ought not to interfere. At last, however, the house grew quiet.</p>
				<p>That night marked the end for Abby McFarland. The next morning she left a brief note for McFarland and fed. From Amity Street she went straight to her friends the Sinclairs, but when she got there neither Mr. nor Mrs. Sinclair was at home. Instead, she found herself facing Miss Perry, Mrs. Sinclair's older sister, and Albert Rich-ardson. He had guessed what her next step would be. There were few places left for her to go. Exhausted by ten years of struggle and humiliation, and worn out by the long scene of the night before, Abby broke down and cried like a tired child. She was through. Miss Perry and Richardson said little, but what they did say was to the point. Miss Perry told her briefly that she was a fool not to have left McFarland long before, and Richardson, with admirable restraint, said simply:</p>
				<p>&quot;This is a matter in which I cannot advise you, but whatever you make up your mind to do, I shall be glad to help you in.&quot;</p>
				<p>Richardson had more than words to offer. He helped her make arrangements to send Percy, her oldest boy, home to her family in Massachusetts; sent word for her to several friends, including the invaluable Mrs. Calhoun; wired her father to come on at once; and, most of all, went himself to McFarland to tell him what had been done and to explain his own position as Abby's friend. This was on the 20th of February, 1867.</p>
				<p>On the 23rd, Mr. Sage came on to New York, and the next day, in the presence of several friends, who had been called in to the Sinclair house for the occasion, Abby told McFarland just why she had left him and that her decision was final. It was a fearful blow to the drunkard's pride. But McFarland was sober and, lacking the accustomed stimulus of liquor, humble. He accepted Abby's word without argument, and only said:</p>
				<p>&quot;I bow to your decision and submit to it.&quot;</p>
				<p>Under the circumstances, there was nothing else for him to do. With all his calm, or perhaps even because of it, Abby urged her father to go home with McFarland and to stay the night with him &quot;to see that he did nothing desperate.&quot; As she herself said afterwards, she might easily have spared herself the trouble. If McFarland did anything desperate, it would not be to himself.</p>
				<p>McFarland left the house with Mr. Sage, and Richardson prepared to go too. Abby went with him to the hall door and tried to thank him for what he had done. Richardson looked at her quietly.</p>
				<p>&quot;How do you feel about facing the world with two babies?&quot; said he, and Abby replied:</p>
				<p>&quot;It looks bad for a woman, but then, I am sure I can get on better without that man than with him.&quot; Richardson nodded, hesitated, and then said:</p>
				<p>&quot;I wish you to remember, my child, that any responsibility you choose to give me in any possible future, I shall be very glad to take.&quot;</p>
				<p>And that was all. It was a very guarded proposal.</p>
				<p>Two days later, on February 26th, Richardson called on Abby at the Sinclair house, where she had taken refuge, and renewed his proposal in more formal and explicit terms. He loved her, and he wanted her to divorce McFarland and marry him. It was reasonable. Any love she had ever had for McFarland had been killed long ago. But divorce was a very serious matter in those days, and while Abby admitted that she cared for him, she wanted to be sure that what he felt for her was more than pity. Also, she badly needed a period of calm, if she could get it, and, moreover, she was unwilling to divorce McFarland in New York, where the only ground was adultery. That was too messy, and there were the children to think of. So they decided to wait. It wouldn't have mattered. Nothing would have mattered. Their names were already written in red, but they didn't know that.</p>
				<p>A day or so after this, Richardson went to Hartford to see his and Abby's publishers, and Abby went back to the rooms on Amity Street, where a friend came to stay with her. McFarland had cleared out.</p>
				<p>On March 9th, Richardson posted a letter to Abby from Hartford that was to be far reaching in its effect. It was a love letter, flowery, after the fashion of the day, but harmless. Later, however, at the trial, each one of its quite innocent phrases was to be twisted about and deliberately misconstrued in the perfectly successful attempt to prove that white was black. Richardson addressed the letter to Abby in care of the Tribune office, no doubt because he thought that was safer. As it turned out, it was the most unsafe thing he could have done, for McFarland strolled into the office, saw the letter, and appropriated it. It was not to be heard of again for almost two years. (While this famous letter is far too long and not sufficiently interesting to quote here, it is worth remarking that to the unprejudiced reader it offers every assurance that the relationship between Abby and Richardson was perfectly innocent.)</p>
				<p>On the 12th, Richardson came back from Hartford, and on the evening of the next day called for Abby at the Winter Garden to take her home after the performance. They had not walked more than a few yards uptown from the theater when McFarland, who had evidently been waiting for them, came up behind and fired several shots at point-blank range. He must have been in his usual condition of drunkenness, however, because he missed Abby altogether, and only succeeded in giving Richardson a slight flesh wound in the side.</p>
				<p>A policeman ran up, McFarland was arrested, and the party adjourned to the station house, where Abby and Richardson refused to press the charge. If they had, it might have made a difference.</p>
				<p>Abby took Richardson to the Sinclairs', where he was put to bed for a day or two. The wound was very slight. If anything had been needed to awaken Abby's love, this incident would have done it. Richardson had been wounded, had escaped death by chance, because of his love for her, and in the hours that she nursed him to recovery she knew that she loved him. Richardson was soon up and about, and Abby departed to stay with her father in Massachusetts.</p>
				<p>On the night of the shooting, as soon as McFarland had been released by the police, he went to Abby's rooms on Amity Street and, after telling the landlady that he was a heartbroken man who had been betrayed by the wife of his bosom, proceeded to break open Abby's trunk and ransack her belongings. He was looking for compromising letters, and while he didn't find any—there being none to find—he did come across several from Mrs. Calhoun and Mrs. Sinclair that, in their warm expression of sympathy and affection, seemed to him to indicate a conspiracy on the part of these fine folk to alienate his wife from him for the express purpose of debauching her. And if this seems far-fetched, it is at least no more than what McFarland's counsel stated at the trial.</p>
				<p>On March 23rd, the famous Winter Garden burned to the ground, and Abby's theatrical career was interrupted for some time to come. She stayed on at Lowell with her father.</p>
				<p>Even before this happened, however, McFarland made his next move in the campaign of persecution he had adopted. He instituted habeas corpus proceedings for the recovery of the two children, Percy and Dan, whom Abby had taken with her. He did more. By means of anonymous letters he tried to break Abby's nerve. In those days, a father's rights in his children, as in his wife, were rather of the Roman variety, and, after a short struggle, Abby agreed to compromise. Percy, the oldest boy, was to go to his father, while Danny, the infant of the family, stayed with her. She hated it, but it was the best she could do. This was in November, '67.</p>
				<p>The next spring Abby went on to New York and tried to see Percy. She was met at the door of their lodgings by a violent storm of outrage and abuse from McFarland, and very little investigation sufficed to show that Percy had not been sent to school, but had been dragged from one rooming house to another by his father, who entertained himself by trying to teach his son to drink. That finished it. Abby now had no other recourse but to sue for divorce and the custody of the children.</p>
				<p>In 1868, Indiana appears to have been the most enlightened state in the Union, so far as marital relations were concerned, or at any rate, so Abby found it. Indiana allowed divorce for drunkenness, extreme cruelty, and for failure to provide. Abby was manifestly entitled to her freedom on all three counts, and in June she started out on her adventure. No small feat in those days.</p>
				<p>Particularly in view of the fact that McFarland's counsel was later to characterize Indiana as &quot;that Paradise of Adulterers,&quot; and was to refer to Abby scathingly as &quot;lurking in an obscure village in the Middle West,&quot; it is interesting to note that she went straight to Indianapolis and settled down there for the next sixteen months, making only one short visit home.</p>
				<p>After the murder, when Abby's name was to provide a paraphrase for the Scarlet Woman, the Indianapolis correspondent of the Cincinnati Commercial was to write under the date of November 30, 1869—a very crucial date in the history of the case—that Mrs. McFarland was possessed of a &quot;dignified and modest demeanor&quot; and had &quot;manifested neither anger nor vindictiveness towards her husband&quot; during her stay in the West. New York papers were far less truthful, but there were reasons for that.</p>
				<p>As soon as Abby got to Indianapolis, she presented letters to the Hon. Albert G. Porter, a distinguished local attorney who was to act for her in her divorce. She told Porter, among other things, that she was compiling a history of the United States for school use, and he introduced her, in turn, to the State librarian. If this history was ever written and published, it seems to have escaped the record, which is a pity, for it would probably have been along strictly Weemsian lines.)</p>
				<p>Abby settled down in the house of Mrs. Mathews, the mother of Vice President Colfax, who was an old friend. She opened a bank account with a Mr. Haughey, into which she paid such small sums as she got from her writ-ings, usually from ten to twenty-five dollars. Out of this she had to support young Danny and herself and save enough for her attorney's fee. She went regularly to the Unitarian Church, like a true daughter of New England, and otherwise went out very little. It is a record so clean that it is almost blank.</p>
				<p>During this Indianapolis interlude, New York seems to have contributed only one incident of moment. McFarland brought civil suit against Albert Richardson, charging that he had alienated Abby's affections, and placing the somewhat high value of $40,000, with interest from the day Abby left him, on his wounded sensibilities. McFarland then published a notice of his suit in which he described himself as a temperate, kind-hearted, good man; and a kind, affectionate, and generous husband,&quot; going on to remark that Richardson had &quot;seduced the affections of my wife from me, and had enticed her from her home.&quot; There was always that about McFarland. He could always be relied upon for a good forthright lie that would cover the entire situation. He was quite right, as events were to show. A half lie might have led him into trouble, but a good thumping falsehood was convincing-to the unin-formed. Richardson replied in a brief, dignified statement which told the truth and was consequently uninteresting.</p>
				<p>Abby's divorce case finally came up before Judge Woolen of Morgan County. Her witnesses were her father and Mrs. Calhoun, both of whom made the long journey out to testify for her. McFarland was painted as a drunken brute and loafer. In fact, in the words of one witness, &quot;a most uncomfortable sort of a person; not fit to live and not prepared to die.&quot; The court apparently accepted this as accurate, as indeed it was, and the divorce was granted without delay. On the 3ist of October, 1869, Abby came back to New York, as free as the courts of Indiana could make her.</p>
				<p>For sixteen months Abby and Richardson had not seen each other, and while we may take it for granted that their reunion was a happy one, no actual record of it exists. Events now moved rapidly to their climax.</p>
				<p>Now, if McFarland had been possessed of only a single one of the virtues with which he had so lavishly endowed himself, this story would have had another ending. But he was not. The man was bad all through, with the sick evil of a mind that had never been robust and that had been feeding for years on the dangerous dreams invoked by the Imp of the Bottle. It is one thing to drink and quite another to be a drunkard. McFarland was a drunkard of long standing, and for some years now he had been able to convince himself that somehow, somewhere, and in some way he had been put upon and defrauded. Inevi-tably, Abby became the symbol of his defeat, and now to know that she was finally out of his power was more than he could endure. Mcfarland was not a nice man, but he was not an unusual one.</p>
				<p>In 1869, the date of Thanksgiving had not been regularized as it has today. That year the holiday fell, not on the last Thursday of the month, but on the Thursday before that, the 18th of November. Abby was at Lowell with her family, and on Thanksgiving Eve Richardson came on from Medway, Massachusetts, where he had been staying with his mother and children, to spend Thanksgiving Day with the woman he was to marry. Abby met him at the railroad station, and they walked up to the house together. On the day following Thanksgiving Richardson went back to New York. Abby was not to see him again until he was on his deathbed.</p>
				<p>How Daniel McFarland spent Thanksgiving is not known, but from the fact that he was drinking hard during all the week that followed, one may conjecture something of the day.</p>
				<p>McFarland's mental condition during the week that intervened between the 18th and the 25th of November is probably most accurately described by saying that he was medically but not legally insane. For a good part of those seven days and nights he wandered through the streets, telling the story of his &quot;wrongs&quot; to anyone who would listen, and punctuating his story with hysterical and maudlin tears. He called on several doctors, complaining of his inability to sleep, and these ingenuous practitioners endeavored to alleviate his distress by the administration of morphia, Indian hemp, better known as hashish, hyosciamus, and simple bromide of potassium. After these incredible doses, McFarland took the taste out of his mouth with more whisky. But—he knew what he was doing.</p>
				<p>By the evening of Thursday, the 25th, all New York knew what he was doing, too, for at a quarter-past five that afternoon he walked into the office of the Tribune and shot Albert Richardson through the body, in the startled presence of young Mr. Daniel Frohman, who thereupon resolved to adopt a theatrical career.</p>
				<p>Whatever he was before that hour, Daniel McFarland was perfectly calm after it. He was to remain so throughout the storm that followed. Newspapers were to grow hysterical in reports, headlines, and editorials. Politicians were to become violent on the issue. Lawyers were to engage in fisticuffs because of the shooting; and the feeling of the public was to be keyed to an almost unbelievable tension over the affair. But Daniel McFarland remained calm through it all—only excepting the few times he was examined by alienists, when he did manage to put on a pretty good show. Who knows? Perhaps he was mad. Madness is debatable. Witness Hamlet!</p>
				<p>And now, having left McFarland some time ago, sitting in the captain's room at the Fourth Precinct Station House, quietly smoking a cigar, we can take up our tale again at that very point. This recapitulation has been necessary because the story has never been plainly told before, and because without it one cannot appreciate the force of what followed.</p>
				<p>The fact that Albert Richardson did not die at once, but lingered on in his room at the Astor House while doctors fought vainly for his life, gave New York just the opportunity it needed to take sides and prepare for battle.</p>
				<p>Abby came on from Massachusetts at once, took up her quarters at the Astor House, and stayed with Richardson until the end. That gave tongues a fine chance to wag, and they wagged freely.</p>
				<p>There was no hope for Richardson from the first— McFarland had done his work too well—and as soon as this was realized, Richardson insisted that he and Abby be married, in order that she might have his name, along with what small property he had to leave, and that she might stand in a legal relationship to his children.</p>
				<p>Divorce, in those days, was in a far worse state of confusion than it is now, and it is bad enough today. Legality and morality were hopelessly entangled, as they usually are, and Church and State looked at each other without trust. Abby's divorce had been obtained in Indiana. Was it binding in New York? McFarland was of the Roman Church, while Abby and Richardson were Protestants. How did that affect matters? Abby and Richardson had hoped that they would be able to straighten this out, quietly and at leisure, but there was no time for that now. They had to act at once, if they were to act at all. Albert Richardson was dying.</p>
				<p>Accordingly, the kindly Mrs. Calhoun, armed with a letter of introduction from Horace Greeley, went to call on that powerful and popular divine, the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher. Mr. Beecher was a broad-minded man— some said too broad—and with him Mrs. Calhoun came to a rather curious agreement.</p>
				<p>Abby and Richardson were to be married and, if Richardson died, the marriage was to be considered as entirely valid. If he did not die, the marriage was not to be consummated until all moot questions of law and morality had been settled to the satisfaction of both Church and State. Certainly, if there is any compromise possible between being married and being unmarried, these two hit upon it.</p>
				<p>By Tuesday, November 3oth, it was clear that Richardson was sinking, and it was decided to perform the ceremony that same day. The officiating clergymen were Henry Ward Beecher, Mr. Frothingham, rector of the church that Richardson attended, and Mr. Henry M. Field of the Evangelist. Albert's brother, C. A. Richardson of Boston, was there with Albert's young son, and there were several friends of Abby's, always including Mrs. Calhoun. Obviously, every precaution was taken to conduct the affair in as circumspect a manner as possible. All the proprieties were rigidly observed. There was no room for criticism, but criticism has a way of making room for itself. The ceremony was brief and dignified, but the hullabaloo that followed was neither.</p>
				<p>Two days later, on December 2nd, Albert Richardson died. On the day following, funeral services were held at the Astor House, and on the day after that at Franklin, Massachusetts, where Richardson was buried. The man had done his honest best to be decent and had been killed for it. This happens less infrequently than one might sup-pose. Richardson was thirty-six years old, though his pictures, consisting, as they do, chiefly of whiskers, make him look older.</p>
				<p>The funeral at the Astor House was notable in that it testified to the fact that among Richardson's friends were such men as Horace Greeley, Whitelaw Reid, and Edmund Clarence Stedman, who were all there along with many more. It was a conclave of such impeccable standing and respectability that one would have thought it above attack. In this, one would have been sadly mistaken.</p>
				<p>The entire city was waiting eagerly to see whether Henry Ward Beecher, in his funeral sermon, would attempt to justify his outrageous behavior in marrying Albert Richardson to his &quot;paramour.&quot; It had gone as far as that already! The city needn't have worried. Mr. Beecher was ready with his answer.</p>
				<p>Beecher's praise of Richardson was moderate in tone, rather astonishingly so under the circumstances, but he did manage to throw three bombs. In speaking of the dead man, he said:</p>
				<p>&quot;That he was imprudent, that his sympathy carried him into ways which a nicer prudence and a larger worldly wisdom would have eschewed is hardly to be doubted. But that he consciously violated any law of God, or any canon of morality which human society has thrown around the household, his most familiar friends utterly deny&quot;</p>
				<p>And again:</p>
				<p>&quot;I believed that she [Abby] was both legally and morally justified in separation from a brutal husband, who, to excessive and outrageous personal abuse, had also furnished that one extreme ground of divorce which justifies it in the eyes of all Christendom.&quot; And finally:</p>
				<p>&quot;I vowed that they [defenders of the Union, of whom Richardson was one, during the recent Civil War] should be my brothers, and that as long as I lived, come what might, if they carried themselves faithfully towards my native land, then they should never lack a friend in me.&quot; </p>
				<p>The first quotation says, in effect, that Richardson did not commit adultery. The second, that McFarland did. The third is a mere gesture.</p>
				<p>Public opinion twisted these statements promptly, with this result.</p>
				<p>Richardson and Abby were guilty of adultery. Therefore, they were adulterers, and Beecher was a defender of adultery. Second, nothing had been said about adultery when Abby got her divorce, and, therefore, in charging McFarland with adultery, Beecher was a liar and McFarland a martyr. Third, in his rhetorical promise to defenders of the Union, Beecher promised to defend all adulterers.</p>
				<p>This may not seem quite sane. It was not sane! It was mad, and it foreshadowed very accurately what followed.</p>
				<p>The only new point that Beecher raised was McFar-land's infidelity. Abby had been quite frank in accusing him of it to her friends, though she had refused to divorce him on those grounds. Mrs. Calhoun had reported this to Beecher. Whether he was actually guilty or not, no one knows, though probably he was.</p>
				<p>This was on December 3rd. The inquest had taken place the day before at the Coroner's Office in City Hall. The proceedings were brief and formal. Proof of the shooting and of Richardson's death was given, and the jury returned a verdict against McFarland, who was remanded for trial. There were two points, however, that stand out as worthy of attention. McFarland was represented by counsel, the leader of which was the then famous John Graham, one of the best known trial lawyers in the city. Where did the money come from for this defense? By whom was McFarland being financed? A contemporary account of the inquest says that:</p>
				<p>&quot;Many politicians crowded into the room, and most of them wore diamond cluster pins of large size and great value. The Coroner had one of these. So did one or two of his friends who conversed with him confidentially. While the testimony was being taken, some one of the politicians was imitating the crowing of a rooster in the hallway. This caused a momentary smile to overspread the countenances of the spectators and others. Almost immediately afterwards, it seemed as though the ceiling was coming down in consequence of a crowd of politicians rushing rudely out of a room overhead.&quot; </p>
				<p>The juxtaposition of ideas in McFarland's mysterious defense fund and a gleeful crowd of politicians, is ines-capable. Boss Tweed was in his heyday of power, and Tammany saw that McFarland was going to be useful. He was useful, very useful indeed.</p>
				<p>Two newspaper editorials, published at this time, show which way the wind was blowing. The New York Sun, in speaking of Richardson's marriage to Abby, said in part:</p>
				<p>&quot;The Astor House, in this city, was the scene, on Tuesday afternoon, of a ceremony which seems to us to set at defiance all those sentiments respecting the relation of marriage, which regard it as anything intrinsically superior to prostitution ... and Mrs. McFarland, alias Miss Sage, whom Richardson, some time ago, seduced from allegiance to her lawful wedded husband. This husband had been guilty of a crime toward his wife—the crime of poverty ... the Rev. Mr. Frothingham, who blasphemed in a prayer to God.&quot;</p>
				<p>That was the general tone. McFarland was a martyr and a saint. Abby was a whore. Richardson, a seducer.</p>
				<p>The Tribune, in commenting on Richardson's death, spoke well of the dead man, as was only to be expected, and ended its editorial with the assertion:</p>
				<p>&quot;In this coming trial it is not alone the State of New York against Daniel McFarland: it is civilization against barbarism. It is the civil code against the code of the as-sassin.&quot;</p>
				<p>The Sun against the Tribune. Dana against Greeley.</p>
				<p>In his cell in the Tombs, Daniel McFarland smiled and said the Sun had done him no more than justice. He further remarked:</p>
				<p>&quot;Since I have been in prison, I have received many visits from ladies and gentlemen, all of whom have expressed their sympathy in the warmest terms. I have today received hundreds of letters from married women, signifying their approval of my course.&quot;</p>
				<p>The usual charity meted out to the &quot;erring sister.&quot; </p>
				<p>And the Evening Republic reported McFarland's brother as saying, in reply to the question:</p>
				<p>&quot;How did this infatuation for Richardson come about?'</p>
				<p>&quot;'It was all along of those Gilbert girls—one of them is a Calhoun now—and of the free-love tribe at Sam Sinclair's house. She [Abby] went reading just to get a chance to paint her face, pass for a beauty, and get in with that free-love tribe at Sam Sinclair's.'&quot; </p>
				<p>We shall hear from the &quot;free-love tribe&quot; presently.</p>
				<p>It is at this point in the story that we come upon that enterprising free-lance (not free-love) journalist, Isaac</p>
				<p>G. Reed, Junior. Reed rocked the boat. The man was a good reporter in a day when editors were important and reporters were not, in contradistinction to present times. Isaac G. Reed was to demonstrate, in advance of his journalistic age, just how dangerous good reporting can be.</p>
				<p>First, Reed interviewed McFarland in the Tombs, but McFarland had already been worked for about all the copy he was good for. He could only retell the story he had already worn threadbare—that he was a kind, loving, and generous husband, who had been driven to drink by the goings-on of his wife, and had finally, in a moment of righteous passion, shot down the man who had &quot;broken up his home.&quot; It was a good story. It always is a good story. It's the same story Adam told about Eve and the Serpent, but Adam didn't get away with it. His many imitators have been far more fortunate. But, in spite of being a good story, it wasn't exactly news. So Reed turned to the Rev. Mr. Beecher.</p>
				<p>Henry Ward stuck to his guns, but there was one weakness in his position that Mr. Reed did not fail to spot. Reed forced Mr. Beecher to admit that the only grounds on which he recognized divorce were adultery, and then reminded him that adultery had not been formally charged. Mr. Beecher replied that he had been assured by his friends that McFarland had been guilty of it none the less, and that Abby McFarland was above all possible reproach. Still, it left him in a somewhat equivo cal position. One remark of Beecher's is especially signifi-cant, in view of the &quot;love scrape&quot; that he was himself to go through in a few years. Reed asked him whether he didn't read the newspapers, to which Beecher replied:</p>
				<p>&quot;Very seldom, and never anything in them that is sensational or horrid. Anything about love scrapes or murders I strenuously avoid. They are not healthy.&quot; He was even more right than he knew.</p>
				<p>It was when Isaac G. Reed interviewed Horace Greeley that he really struck oil. Probably, in saving that interview for the last, he recognized that possibility. The interview with Beecher had appeared in the relatively unimportant Sunday Mercury, but the Greeley story was splashed across the pages of the Sun. While it is impossible to give the Greeley interview in extenso, there are portions of it that must be preserved to an admiring posterity. After a little preliminary licking of his chops, Mr. Reed continues:</p>
				<p>&quot;Accordingly, we entered the Tribune office about five o'clock last Saturday afternoon, and after being suspiciously eyed by the various clerks and attachés of the es-tablishment, and after having our ears shocked by an imprecation from Ottarson, who, like his illustrious chief, has forgotten all about the Third Commandment, we contrived to get our card laid before the eyes of the Hon. Horace Greeley, who immediately desired us to be ad-mitted.</p>
				<p>&quot;Ascending forthwith the winding, narrow, rickety stairs which led to the sanctum, we found Mr. Greeley in his den. 'He sat like an editor taking his ease, with his Mss. all around him,' and various specimens of his all but undecipherable penmanship, lay on all sides of his desk, above which the lamp light shone full upon his venerable head and upturned spectacles.&quot;</p>
				<p>The first point that Mr. Reed wanted to cover was whether or not Mr. Greeley had made a direct request of the Rev. Mr. Beecher to marry Abby and Richardson. Mr. Greeley denied emphatically that he had done so. He had simply given Mrs. Calhoun a letter to Mr. Beecher and had left the rest to her. And now let us follow the excellent Mr. Reed's example, and give a part of the interview in question and answer form.</p>
				<p>GREELEY: I have not the slightest doubt that Mrs. Calhoun told Mr. Beecher the truth; that you may be sure of. You may depend what she said was true, every word of it; but I gave her no authority to represent me. Nobody can represent me!</p>
				<p>REED: No one can adequately represent so wonderful a man.</p>
				<p>[Mutual bows.]</p>
				<p>GREELEY: But I tell you what it is, sir, there are plenty of people who can misrepresent me, and they are doing it just about all the time!</p>
				<p>REED: How?</p>
				<p>GREELEY: In the newspapers, in the Herald, the Sunday Mercury—all the papers. They have all told lies about me, and the people believe them-because they want to or because they don't know any better. Why, they have all garbled the evidence in this matter regarding the Sinclairs!</p>
				<p>REED: In what respect?</p>
				<p>GREELEY: Why, they have suppressed in their published reports all the material facts in the testimony! What if Mr. Richardson and Mrs. McFarland did occupy the same room, or about the same room, as they call it? Don't they know well enough that Mr. Richardson was a wounded and feeble man? But no! It don't suit the papers to publishthat!If all the testimony was published, the Sinclairs would be all right, but no-they must garble it to suit their damned petty malice! No, the Sinclairs and all the rest of us must be identified with this free-love crowd. By God [bringing his venerable fist down upon the desk], there's no such crowd—at least, not around the Tribune office. The whole thing has been got up by the enemies of the Tribune!</p>
				<p>REED: I do not exactly understand.</p>
				<p>GREELEY: There is the World, for instance, talking about the morality of the Tribune, when it hasn't any of its own! Why, if it hadn't been that the parties were in some way or another connected with the Tribune, there wouldn't have been a mother's son of the whole lot but would have thought it all right that Mrs. McFarland should be called Mrs. Richardson!</p>
				<p>After which there was a wordy war between the two on the legality of the divorce and the consequent marriage. Greeley then made the statement, which should have been accorded more attention than it got, that McFarland had given up all rights in his wife of his own free will.</p>
				<p>GREELEY: Yes, he told me so himself. You see, I didn't know about the case in any particular way until some time before the first shooting. Mac called upon me personally one day, and told me distinctly, &quot;Mr. Greeley, I don't care about the woman. I don't want to get her back again. I wouldn't take her back. I do not want to live with her again. But that man has treated me badly!&quot; Or some words meaning the same thing. I listened to him, and tried to comfort him; and then the villain— the dirty, deliberate, damned villain —shot Richardson! And then he called on me again, and I told him I wouldn't have any more to do with him. &quot;You're a bad man, Mac!&quot; said I. Yes, I told him that he was a bad man, and so he is—a very bad man! And then, just look at that rascally recorder! What a damned pretty judge he is to talk in that style! He's a disgrace, by God! But the whole thing will be a nine-days' wonder, and then the people will forget all about it, or else they will learn the truth about it. And for my part, I hope the matter will be well ventilated, for I believe that the marriage of Albert D. Richardson and that woman was a just and true one, under the circumstances, and I think that the people, when they know all about it, will think so too.</p>
				<p>Whereupon Mr. Reed gently rebuked Mr. Greeley for letting himself be used as a cat's-paw and took his hat and his departure.</p>
				<p>Now, this is all very entertaining, if only because it is just about as typical a picture of Horace Greeley on the warpath as one could get. At the same time, however, that shrewd old fighter put his finger unerringly on the crux of the whole affair. The real issue was already lost sight of in the chance to attack the Tribune. There were other factors involved.</p>
				<p>Adultery had sidetracked murder in the public mind, as it usually does in Anglo-Saxon communities which consider adultery much the more heinous crime of the two because it is so much more enjoyable. The point of view of the public on adultery is, generally, &quot;I want to commit adultery, but I don't dare; and, by heaven, if I can't I'm not going to let you!&quot; In other words—sour grapes. But, all this quite aside, there was no actual issue of adultery here —unless it was McFarland's—for there was not and never has been one jot or tittle of evidence indicating an improper relationship between Abby and Richardson. The thing was manufactured. There were three curious reasons why this was done.</p>
				<p>First, there was the newspaper war, which was being fought with almost incredible violence in that day of bitter editorial enmities. Horace Greeley and his Iribune were on one side, and everybody else was on the other. Not that that bothered Greeley in the slightest, for a newspaper was nothing but a weapon to him, and a weapon that he well knew how to use. Dana had taken over the Sun in 1868, having quit Greeley in 1861, after fourteen years on the Tribune, and his parting from his old chief was not cordial. Bennett, of the Herald, had been at bitter odds with Greeley since before the Civil War, chiefly because Bennett felt that avoiding the war was more important than freeing the slaves, while Greeley was a red-hot Abolitionist. The World, the only other paper of real consequence, was just coming into power and was more than willing to be a thorn in anybody's side. And Greeley was a violent man. He did not have opinions: he had passions. Either you were for him or you were against him, and if you were against him it was up to you to look out for your own skin. That type of man can exist only so long as he is able to defend himself. Once his guard is down—the pack is on him. These papers and their editors, along with the smaller fry, saw in the Richardson-McFar-land affair the chance to push Greeley in a corner—to make him appear to be the defender of immorality, of free love and what-not. They cared nothing for the facts they were distorting out of any reasonable shape and nothing for the justice they were perverting, or, if they cared about these matters at all, they cared about them far less than they did about the chance to knife Greeley and the Tribune. Use the tar brush. Blacken. Besmirch. No matter, so that Greeley was hit.</p>
				<p>Second, there was the situation with Tammany. Boss Tweed was in his full flush of power; New York politics were as rotten as Tammany was able to make them, and every decent paper in the city was up in arms. (They put down their arms long enough to attack the Tribune, how-ever. They didn't hate Tammany less, but Greeley more.) McFarland was a Romanist, which counted with Tam-many. He was a ward-heeler. And, most of all, he had shot a friend of Greeley's; his wife had divorced him for love of a Tribune correspondent. His enemies were friends of the Tribune. To defend him was to attack the Tribune and Greeley, Tammany's most feared and hated foe. The choice was not difficult.</p>
				<p>McFarland thus had en his side Tammany, who would have defended him anyway, if it had bothered with him at all, which is very doubtful; and the entire press of New York, who were willing to forego their fight with Tammany to hit the Tribune. But the third factor was the most important of all. That was public opinion.</p>
				<p>The United States was, at this time, in the throes of one of those &quot;moral blizzards&quot; which now and again make havoc of its sanity. Whole libraries of books have been written to explain these phenomena, but most of the explanations differ unaccountably. It is a peculiarity of this country alone, and is probably what we mean when we refer to our &quot;national institutions.&quot; The visible symbol of this outbreak was three words—Free Love and Fourierism.</p>
				<p>Free love is always with us, more or less. We keep it in mothballs and drag it out when we lack other excitement. We had it not long ago when the alleged Soviet theory of the &quot;communization of women&quot; filled us with hope and alarm. An agitator and a soap box, with free love as the theme for the bedtime story, will always draw a crowd. In this instance, it remained only for Mr. Fourier to cast the first stone.</p>
				<p>Fourier was a French philosopher who published his treatise in 1798, just when the French Revolution was gasping its life out, and whose work was promptly suppressed by Napoleon as soon as he was in a position to do any suppressing. Precisely what Fourierism was cannot be compassed in a few words, and a few words are all that it deserves. Enough, that it was one of the many Utopias of the period, faintly communistic, painfully logical, utterly impractical, and slightly poetic. It was well calculated to appeal to the Penthouse Pink of that age, and could only have been feared by the type of mind that would see a phallic symbol in a lollipop.</p>
				<p>Some time before this, Horace Greeley had permitted Alfred Brisbane, father of Mr. Hearst's famous editor, to write a series of articles on Fourierism for the Tribune. Mr. Brisbane was young and enthusiastic, and his articles had all the persuasive eloquence of a modern super-salesman— except that there were not many people willing to sign on the dotted line. To say that readers of the Tribune were shocked is to put it very mildly indeed. Outraged fathers of families seemed to see wives and daughters skittering off on the next train to disport themselves in Monsieur Fourier's experimental colony in a manner more advanced than becoming. An extract from a contemporary writer shows how they felt about it.</p>
				<p>&quot;Free lovers are a class who should be shunned by any right-thinking person who wishes to preserve their purity and prevent the tongue of scandal being opened upon them. They should shun them as they would a serpent, whose venomous fangs would cause them instant death. What feeling can these people have for their wives, when they expose their portraits, taken in a state of nudity, and pass them from one to another, to pander to the vicious taste of such questionable company? And yet such scenes as this are said to have been enacted in the New York Tribune office!&quot;</p>
				<p>It is difficult to believe that even the most ardent free-lover could be much excited by a portrait of fat little Horace Greeley, with his fringe of white whiskers, in a state of nudity, but this sort of thing was taken seriously, none the less. One need not dwell on the curious English used by the writers of these diatribes. It would be too painful. But, astounding as it is, they were believed!</p>
				<p>It must be clear by this that the Richardson-McFarland case had become a three-ringed circus, in which an infinite variety of clowns danced feverishly around the lonely figure of Abby Richardson and the dead body of the man she had loved. It is an elevating spectacle.</p>
				<p>Richardson had died on December 2nd, and Mcfar-land's trial was finally set for the 4th of the following April, 1870.</p>
				<p>The fates chose the time well, for if the trial had come only a few months later public interest might have been diverted to the Franco-Prussian War, which broke out in July; to the still mysterious murder of that prominent citizen of New York, Benjamin Nathan, or to the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, which was got under way that summer. In April, however, there was nothing to distract attention from the question of whether or not Daniel McFarland should be hanged for murder.</p>
				<p>The trial was held before Recorder Hackett, that rame Recorder of whom Horace Greeley had said, &quot;What a damned pretty judge he is!&quot;—a remark, by the way, which indicates that Mr. Hackett had made some extra-judicial statement soon after the killing, though what it may have been has been lost to history. Recorder Hackett was the son of Baron Hackett, the Shakespearean scholar and actor, and was well known as a baiter of the so-called free-love school. (One still wonders what on earth free love had to do with it!)</p>
				<p>Chief of counsel for McFarland was John Graham, who had already appeared for the defense in the coroner's court. Graham had appeared as counsel in a number of causes célebres, and was well known for his emotional outpour-ings. Put him in front of a jury, and John Graham could and would &quot;throw fits&quot; from dawn to dark. He was much esteemed. He had defended Daniel E. Sickles in 1859 on a charge of murdering his wife's lover, and had got him triumphantly acquitted. The sanctity-of-the-home was Graham's especial care.</p>
				<p>Associated with John Graham was Charles S. Spencer, who made the opening address for the defense, an address which in the violence of its attack on Abby and Richardson piled lies on distortions, and of which Mr. Spencer was himself so thoroughly ashamed, when he had had time to sober up, that he published an apology and resigned from the case shortly after the trial opened. His defection was &quot;much to the chagrin and astonishment of both the senior and junior counsel with whom he was connected, and on the strong expression of their personal and professional indignation.&quot; Mr. Spencer's associates were not ones to let a little thing like truth and justice stand in their way, and they naturally resented such squeamishness on the part of Mr. Spencer.</p>
				<p>McFarland's junior counsel was none other than Elbridge T. Gerry, who was later to found the S.P.C.C., and who was then thirty-three years old. Mr. Gerry was &quot;looked upon by the Bar of New York as one of its most promising, if not its ablest, young lawyers.&quot;</p>
				<p>The defense was well represented by exceedingly able men. It was afterwards known that the fee paid defense counsel was $10,000. Where did that money come from?</p>
				<p>The question has never been answered.</p>
				<p>Judge Garvin and Judge Davis appeared for the state. They were both good lawyers, but of no special distinction. Too often counsel for the state are possessed of precisely these qualifications.</p>
				<p>The case lasted more than a month, the jury returning their verdict on the 10th of May.</p>
				<p>It would be a fruitless task, tedious alike to reader and writer, to deal in detail with McFarland's trial. In very truth it had already been held by a public opinion that had been whipped into flame by politicians and by conscienceless press. What remained could be little more than a formality.</p>
				<p>The state presented its case against McFarland clearly and simply. He had deliberately killed Richardson, and he had known what he was doing when he fired the shot. There was no difficulty in proving this, and the testimony was presented without flourish. Perhaps that was its fault.</p>
				<p>The defense opened on the second day. It admitted the shooting: there was no question as to that; but it advanced the claim that at the time of the murder McFarland was not responsible for his action by reason of the fact that he had been driven insane through the conduct of his wife and Albert Richardson. It was on this correlative clause that the entire emphasis was placed. It is entirely possible that McFarland might have been proven irresponsible without stressing this alleged reason. He was known as an habitual drunkard, given to ungovernable fits of temper, and physicians testified to his mental condition during the week before the shooting and to the many and varied drugs which they had given him. Undoubtedly, there was a proper legal defense in McFarland's mental state. But this was not enough. This would provide no mud which might be thrown on Greeley, Beecher, Sinclair, and everyone else who was connected in any way with the Tribune interests. The only way in which these could be reached was to prove or to try to prove the immorality of Abby Mcfar-land and of Richardson, for these two were friends of and had been defended by the group it was necessary to blacken. The matter of McFarland's sanity or insanity was almost passed over in the mad fury of the defense to show not simply that he was insane but why!</p>
				<p>The actual defense then was that Abby and Richardson had maintained an adulterous relationship, and that Richardson had finally seduced Abby into leaving her home and husband, depriving him of his beloved children, and that this series of events had resulted in McFarland's mental downfall. In spite of the fact that Graham and Gerry worked for days in the effort to establish these alleged facts they were not able to adduce one iota of evidence to support their contention! And in spite of their utter failure, the &quot;damned pretty judge&quot; on the bench permitted and encouraged them to make statements and allegations in speech after speech to the jury which were vitally damaging to Abby and to Richardson, and which they were totally unable to prove. It was a sickening ex-hibition. When the state tried to offer rebutting testimony in disproof of these contentions, the court ruled that it was unnecessary to rebut mere statements of counsel. But the court permitted the statements to go on!</p>
				<p>McFarland's crime was justified on the grounds that Richardson had robbed him of his wife, while, as a matter of fact, his wife had not lived with him for more than two years before the shooting, and at the time of the murder was not his legal wife at all!</p>
				<p>When Judge Davis protested to the court and tried to show how outrageous this procedure was, Graham blustered to his feet, calling Davis a &quot;damned coward&quot; and shouting, &quot;I'll have the clothes off your back! God damn you, I can lick you! I'll teach you what is due one gentleman to another!&quot; Whereupon, McFarland, the supposedly insane man, put his hand on Graham's arm and said, &quot;I hope you will not do anything to prejudice my case.&quot; Comment is superfluous.</p>
				<p>Much was made of the letter from Richardson to Abby, which McFarland had intercepted. It has not been quoted here because it is neither interesting nor significant of anything beyond the fact that the two were in love with each other and, so far as the letter proves anything, in love in the most circumspect and proper manner. That it could have roused anyone to the point of murder is absurd, and yet defense counsel, via Mr. Spencer, were to say:</p>
				<p>&quot;I believe it is my best trait that I love my wife, and I believe she is as pure as an angel. But if ever I discovered a letter like that to her from any man, I would shoot him whether it made me mad or not!&quot;</p>
				<p>This was greeted with cheers. And yet we are annoyed when foreigners sneer at American justice!</p>
				<p>This burlesque went on for a good five weeks, but the end finally came, it may well be through sheer exhaustion. At eight o'clock on the evening of May 10th the jury retired. It was an hour and fifty-five minutes before they were ready with their verdict.</p>
				<p>A report had run through the still crowded courtroom that ten of the jury were for clear acquittal, only the foreman and one other holding out for conviction. They did not hold out long.</p>
				<p>A contemporary report of the trial says that the words Not Guilty were &quot; ... drowned in a shout-not a cheer, not a hurrah—a simple emission of voice, in which, though it burst from over 300 persons, there was not a discordant note. It was one long, clear sound that seemed to proceed from one throat. It shook the windows, and seemed to vibrate back from the very walls. Cheer rose upon cheer. Hats were waved, and ladies, springing from their chairs, waved their handkerchiefs and joined their high notes to the deeper cheers of the men. Some ladies crowded around Mcfarland, shaking hands with him, and some kissing him.&quot;</p>
				<p>Clearly, it was a very popular verdict.</p>
				<p>Abby had, wisely, stayed away from the trial. A little later she issued her own statement, telling the whole story of her relationship with both McFarland and Richardson, and giving it all in a very simple and dignified way. This she put into the form of a deposition to which she took oath. Her own last paragraph may well be ours also.</p>
				<p>&quot;There is but one word more to say, and I will say it briefy. It is well known that I have been on trial before a New York court as much as Daniel McFarland, and for a crime more heinous and more bitterly punished in a woman than murder committed by a man. And it is clearly seen by all who see dispassionately that wherever a loop-hole was opened for any truth about my conduct or Mr. Richardson's it was immediately stopped. I have tasted to its dregs the cup of justice which, in the nineteenth century, men born of women mete out to one whose worst crime was the mistake of marrying a man who was half madman from natural inheritance, half brute from natural proclivity. Of the justice I have received, let those who read my story bear witness.&quot; </p>
				<p>That witness is borne here.</p>

				<head type="chapter">THE ABSENT WITNESS</head>
				<p>IT WAS an evening in mid-June of the year 1870. The scrub pine that bordered the wandering Maine woods road hunched itself grotesquely in the gathering dusk.</p>
				<p>A woman lay dead beneath the pine boughs. A man drove away as fast as he could lash his horse down the narrow road.</p>
				<p>No one had seen. And yet, there was one who would see —a witness who had not been there.</p>
				<p>Sixty years ago, the town or city-may we be forgiven if we seem to belittle it— of Lewiston, Maine, showed the definite beginnings of what it is today, as the boy is, pro-verbially, father to the man. The start of the present manu-factories was there. Bates College was there, and there was a College Street to go with it. It is true that Lewiston has always suffered from the fact that it is just across the Androscoggin River from Auburn, the county seat, but, even so, it has always held its own.</p>
				<p>It would, one fears, be idle to indulge in a psalm of praise of the many beauties of the state of Maine; its enchanting lakes, its rivers of romance, and the long shadows cast by its mountains. Enough that, in a singularly beautiful part of the United States, Maine, like Lewiston, can more than hold its own. On, then, to the story.</p>
				<p>On Saturday, the rith of June, 1870, the circus was at Lewiston. On one hand, circuses in summer, and traveling theatrical companies, popularly known as &quot;barn stormers,&quot; in winter, were just about all the day and age provided to the small provincial town by way of public entertainment. On the other hand, what roughly corresponds in this country to the county families of England did not patronize these especial forms of dissipation. It was &quot;not done.&quot; The vices of the elect, like most of their virtues, were modestly thrust out of sight.</p>
				<p>Jim and Lizzie Lowell of Lewiston went to the circus just the same that Saturday night. They weren't county families, and they didn't care. They liked it. In fact, Lizzie liked it so much that James was moved to comment bitterly, and later, much later, a queer story got round town.</p>
				<p>Anyhow, this was no ordinary circus. It was the Great Australian Circus, and young Wilmot Nelson of the DeWitt House ran away with it when it pulled out on Monday morning. It was Wilmot who told the queer story, but he was older then.</p>
				<p>In any event, quite a lot happened in Lewiston from Saturday night, when the circus gave its gala performance, to Monday morning, when the panting train yanked it away. Some of what happened is conjecture.</p>
				<p>On Sunday morning early, there was a very bad fire in Lewiston. Central Hall, referred to in subsequent reports as &quot;the pride of the city,&quot; was burned to the ground. No one ever knew how the fire started and, when they thought they knew what had happened on the evening of that day, no one cared. The happening is unimportant today, except as marking a date that no Lewistonian of that generation ever forgot.</p>
				<p>Jim and Lizzie Lowell were there at the fire with the rest. According to later testimony, they were on different sides of the street, and on terms of only casual profanity— chiefly contributed by Jim. There can be no possible doubt, however, but that they were both there, watching Central Hall burn. The fire burned until late that afternoon.</p>
				<p>Lizzie Lowell worked for Mrs. Sophronia Blood, who lived at 1o Hill Corporation, and sometime between six and seven that evening, after the supper dishes had been washed, Jim came to take Lizzie for a drive. They weren't living together, these two, because Jim had such a violent temper. It was mid-June, and the sun had not yet set. Jim came for her with a white horse and buggy, and they drove away up towards the college. It was fairly early, and there were still people in the street to see them pass, but, after they got to the outskirts of town, where Switzerland Road marked the beginning of the farming district, they were not seen again. It was a popular drive in summer, especially on Sundays, and while the term &quot;necking&quot; was not to make its appearance for a half century or so, the prac-tise itself was thriving then, just as it always has. The period was about midway between &quot;bundling&quot; and &quot;pet-ting,&quot; and had developed no cant word of its own.</p>
				<p>It does not matter. Jim and Lizzie Lowell were seen driving out on Switzerland Road on that warm June eve-ning.</p>
				<p>They were never seen together again.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Blood, like a prudent housewife, locked up every evening at ten o'clock sharp; and this evening she followed her usual procedure, in spite of the fact that Lizzie had not yet come home. Being a kindly person, however, Mrs. Blood decided to give the girl the benefit of the doubt— after all, she was out with her husband—and waited up for her another half hour. Still no Lizzie. It was late. Mrs. Blood went upstairs to bed.</p>
				<p>The next morning Lizzie had still not appeared, and Mrs. Blood took it for granted that husband and wife had spent the night together. Consequently, during the fore-noon, when she saw Jim Lowell driving slowly by with his team—he was a teamster by vocation—she ran out of the house and stopped him.</p>
				<p>&quot;Where's Lizzie this morning?&quot; inquired Mrs. Blood.</p>
				<p>Jim sat in the high driver's seat, looking down at his boots. Without raising his head, he answered:</p>
				<p>&quot;I left her at your door at ten o'clock last night.&quot; </p>
				<p>Mrs. Blood was annoyed and showed it in her reply.</p>
				<p>&quot;You didn't do any such a thing! I waited till ten o'clock, and when I came down to lock up, she hadn't come. I waited till between ten and eleven. I know she hadn't come!&quot;</p>
				<p>Still Jim wouldn't look at her, and his response came with a snarl.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes, I did! When I turned to go on the Corporation, the clock was striking ten. ... I suppose she went off with that damned circus fellow!&quot;</p>
				<p>Mrs. Blood was not impressed. She snorted.</p>
				<p>&quot;Humph! Jim, I want you to see if you can find Lizzie for me. I need her. She's working for me. You know that. Now, you find her!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said Jim, and drove away.</p>
				<p>The lives of Jim and Lizzie Lowell, even before the crucial date of June 12, 1870, had not been devoid of incident.</p>
				<p>Jim was born in Rangely, in 1843, and was taken to live in Lewiston as a child. In 1861, when Jim was eight-een, he enlisted in the Union army and served with the 23rd Maine Regiment for about a year. He was not wounded, but he seems to have considered a year's service sufficient to sate his thirst for glory. So he came back home and resumed his occupation of teamster and local Don Juan.</p>
				<p>Lizzie was a year older than Jim. She too had known romance. When she was sixteen she had married a John Nichols and had lived with him for five years in Edding-ton. At the expiration of that time, John had felt the call of the wild and had deserted her for golden California. That was in 1863.</p>
				<p>It was in '67 when Jim Lowell and Lizzie met, and by the time they had known each other two months they had decided to pool their misfortunes. True, Lizzie had never gone through the formality of divorcing John Nichols, but that couldn't be helped, and nobody cared much any-how. Maine people mind their own business. So the two settled down together on College Street, Lewiston, and proceeded to make the worst of a bad bargain.</p>
				<p>Lizzie's virtues, or the lack of them, as a wife, are un-recorded, but that Jim was a sad failure as a husband there can be no question. He made no pretense of abandoning his rôle of the Great Lover, and his infidelities ran neck-and-neck with his opportunities to be unfaithful. This sort of thing does not make for a happy marriage or even for a reasonably peaceful home life. It irritated Lizzie, and when she permitted her irritation to become expressive, Jim beat her-not hard, but with very little sympathy. He also swore at her often and, on one occasion at least, is said to have threatened her life. At last they separated, but they continued to observe the outward amenities.</p>
				<p>The community exacted that tribute. They might live together as man and wife without being legally married— as long as they pretended it wasn't so. They might inflict what violence they liked upon each other—as long a they kept the shades down. But outwardly they must appear to be a conventionally respectable couple.</p>
				<p>The truth is that Puritanism in America fed New England at about the end of the witch-burning era and took up its habitation in the Great Open Spaces. It is there that it is to be found today. Puritanism seems to follow the pioneer.</p>
				<p>This was the state of affairs in June, 1870, when Mrs. Blood suddenly found herself deprived of Lizzie's services.</p>
				<p>Whether in accordance with his promise to Mrs. Blood or for other reasons, Jim Lowell let it be known that Lizzie had run away with the &quot;circus fellow&quot; and that he was going to follow them to Portland and take a policeman with him. He did, in fact, go away for a day or two, but whether or not he went to Portland no one ever knew, and the policeman was very generally doubted. Jim had never hungered after policemen before. When he got back to Lewiston, Jim said briefly that the circus had gone beyond Portland, taking Lizzie with it; that he didn't know where she was at the moment and didn't particularly care. She'd left him. That was that.</p>
				<p>There was no uproar. Maine isn't like that. But there was a lot of talking out behind barn doors, and a generally uneasy feeling that there had been dirty work somewhere. But—Jim Lowell seemed to be able to mind his own business, and his neighbors guessed they could mind theirs.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Sarah Elizabeth Burton, the mother of the now missing Lizzie Lowell, lived in Dedham, Maine, or, more exactly, in &quot;East Holden, within one hundred rods of the line of Dedham,&quot; usually receiving her mail at the latter address. Late in May, 1870, Mrs. Burton had a letter from her son-in-law that was later to be marked &quot;I&quot; and placed in evidence. This letter, which follows, is not only interesting in itself as an example of Jim Lowell's epistola-tory style, but is important in the basis for comparison it offers with letters alleged to have been written by Lizzie after her disappearance.</p>
				<p>May the 20 1870</p>
				<p>Dear mother</p>
				<p>I thought i would rite you a few lines to let you no that lyzie has left me again and afor what reson i dont no it is no use to try to live with her for i cant think Just so much of her i saw georga to Day She said She had not seane her if She has come home rite and tell me for i should like to know tell her to have her picture taken and Send me So good By</p>
				<p>J M Lowell</p>
				<p>rite as soon as you get this</p>
				<p>Second Page</p>
				<p>i dont think She used me very well in going of in the way thet She did She told miss Clark thet She was a going to Live with her first husbun i have not told you all i may come and See you Some time and tell you all about it</p>
				<p>Mrs. Burton was not greatly impressed at the time. Jim and Lizzie would have to work out their own salvation like other married folks. Incidently, &quot;georga&quot; is Georgia, another daughter of Mrs. Burton's, who was also living in Lewiston. The reference to Lizzie's &quot;first husbun&quot; is more interesting. This gentleman had returned from California and was living in Maine, though there is nothing to show that he ever tried to communicate with his wife, much less to disturb her extra-marital relationship. Did Lizzie hold him over Jim as a threat, or—was Tim the one who threatened? We shall probably never know. Whatever original ideas about spelling and punctuation Jim Lowell had, Georgia Burton testified that he was proud of his writing. Looking over his shoulder one day, Georgia remarked:</p>
				<p>&quot;You're a pretty splendid writer, ain't you, Jim?&quot; To which Jim replied:</p>
				<p>&quot;Oh, Lord, yes! I kept school once.&quot;</p>
				<p>All of which may have been intended as a joke at the time, but which was anything but funny later.</p>
				<p>Lizzie's defection was to be of short duration, however, for not long afterwards a second letter followed the first.</p>
				<p>June the 5 1870</p>
				<p>Dear mother i seat my Self to rite you a few Lines to Let you no that She has come back we are all well and i hope these few Lines will find you The Same we are coming down in a few weeks So good by and good Luck.</p>
				<p>from James M Lowell</p>
				<p>rite as soon as you get this</p>
				<p>The date of this letter, June 5th, is exactly a week to the day before the evening that Lizzie disappeared.</p>
				<p>The days slipped by. Jim Lowell did not write again, and Mrs. Burton was unable to get any response to her letters to Lizzie and her sister Georgia. And then she be-thought herself of an old friend who also lived in Lewiston, one Mrs. Murrey, and so it was to Mrs. Murrey that she turned for news. Mrs. Murrey's letter was not produced in evidence, nor was she herself called as a witness, but it is clear that she told Mrs. Burton that Lizzie had not been seen since the night of June 12th and that something ought to be done about it. The same evening that she got Mrs. Murrey's letter, Mrs. Burton wrote again to Jim demanding the facts. Jim, ever the ready letter writer, replied forthwith.</p>
				<p>August the 4 1870</p>
				<p>Dear mother i take this optunity to answer you kind Leter witch i got a few days ago and was glad to hear from you hav not heard from lizza sence She went away only whot a girl told me She told me that She saw her after the forth She told her that she was going to leave the place for good and never would never see her a gain for she should never rite to me georga was out here last weeke and i have not scene since give my love to all and a Large shere to your self So good By and good Luck.</p>
				<p>from James M Lowell</p>
				<p>i am coming down in a few weeks </p>
				<p>rite and tell me All the news</p>
				<p>Taken at its face value this letter was certainly a somewhat casual announcement, but on the other hand Lizzie had walked out before and had come back. In any event, Mrs. Burton had no intention of taking it at its face value. Thoroughly alarmed, she left for Lewiston at once. This was the last of August, more than a month after Lizzie had disappeared. The visit was short and singularly in-conclusive.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Burton encountered Jim Lowell quite casually in &quot;Mr. Harlow's shoe store.&quot; This was on an evening, &quot;the very last of August.&quot; Jim was driving past the store when Mrs. Burton stepped out and hailed him. Paying no attention to her, Jim entered another store near by. Mrs. Burton followed him and found him &quot;doing up a bag.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Hello, Jim,&quot; said Mrs. Burton, and walked through the shop into another room. Jim followed, and husband and mother faced each other.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Burton lost no time in getting to the point. &quot;Where is Lizzie?&quot; said she.</p>
				<p>Jim hesitated and then replied, &quot;It is no place to talk here. Let's go down street.&quot; They went out of the store together, and again Mrs. Burton asked, &quot;Where is Lizzie?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;She is in Lawrence,&quot; answered Jim.</p>
				<p>&quot;How do you know?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;A man told me.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Who is this man and where is he?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;He lives around here.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;You tell me who and where he is, and I'll see him and talk with him!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;His name is Charlie something. I can't remember.&quot; </p>
				<p>At this point they came to the corner of the street, and Georgia, who had evidently joined them, said bluntly, &quot;Don't let us walk with a murderer!&quot; Jim didn't reply, but walked off down Lisbon Street alone.</p>
				<p>The next day Mrs. Burton went to the city marshal, but he had no suggestion to make. Lizzie Lowell might be alive or dead. Jim Lowell might or might not have guilty knowledge of what had happened to her. Who could tell? Mrs. Burton and Georgia went to Mrs. Blood's and got Lizzie's clothes. That same day Mrs. Burton went back home to Dedham. It cannot be said that the inquiry was dropped, for no inquiry had been made.</p>
				<p>When Mrs. Burton and Georgia went to Mrs. Blood's, that hot August day, they saw for the first time a letter that Mrs. Blood had picked up in the back yard of her house (how it got there no one knew) within two weeks of Lizzie's disappearance. This letter was addressed to Miss blood, and read:</p>
				<p>Dear friend</p>
				<p>Tell my Dear beloved husbun that he will never see me again i hav don wrong i have Lied a bout him he never used me bad but once i want you to see him and tell him i want you to giv him all of my clothes tell that girl that goes with Savage that i want her to cort Jimy and have him She never can get a beter one (tell Jennie to kiss Jimmy three times for me)</p>
				<p>Lizzie</p>
				<p>Jennie was one of Mrs. Blood's three daughters, and when Mrs. Blood read the letter she tore off the sentence given here in parentheses. Mrs. Blood seems to have suspected that Jim was being given too many breaks.</p>
				<p>That of course is the peculiar thing about the letter. If Lizzie wrote it she certainly had an eye to Jim's interests. From a very jealous wife she had turned into a very model of altruism. Jim was given a clean bill of health—and all of Lizzie's clothes. He was to have the &quot;girl that goes with Savage,&quot; and pretty Jennie was to kiss him three times. If Lizzie wrote the letter she had undoubtedly changed. On the other hand, it was just such a letter as Jim himself might have written.</p>
				<p>In exchange for a sight of this remarkable epistle, Georgia produced and showed to Mrs. Blood a letter that she herself had received only a few days before. Not only to complete the documents in the case, but for the sake of its own interest, the letter is inserted here.</p>
				<p>Aug the 1 1870</p>
				<p>Dear Sister</p>
				<p>I take the pen in hand to Let you no i am not ded i am in the place named ded-hum. Addie is very Cick i think yu better Go home now if You dont Come home now You never Will See her be case the doctor Ses She never Will Get Well a Gain Whare is gim and What is he duing Georgie Will you please Go Over to miss blood and Get What thinges i have Got Over there bee Cause i have nuthing but my Cilk dress down here and Muther Gave me a Calico dress to were duing hose Work in and that is all i have Gut down here You git those thinges and box them up and Cend them to me and dont tell George Yu Can tell Miss blood war i am but tell her not to tel gim Show this letter to Miss blood i Cant Write no more now a Sunday i See martha last Sunday She Want yu to Come home Get those things be Chure and if you Cum home you may pack my things in your trunk and bring them things Write home With Your things and if you dont Come home you may put them in a box and Cend them home by express be Chure and not tell gim dont let aney wone no that yu have heard from me</p>
				<p>Good by from your sister</p>
				<p>Lizzie M Lowell</p>
				<p>Get the things As Soon As yu Can.</p>
				<p>&quot;Curiouser and curiouser,&quot; quoth Alice, and Mrs. Blood, Mrs. Burton, and Georgia thought so too. If the letter to Miss blood was dubious in its thoughtfulness for gim, this letter contained an outright lie, for Lizzie had never been in ded-hum at all, or certainly not at the time it was written.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Burton returned from Lewiston to Dedham in a very unhappy state of mind.</p>
				<p>We come now to a very remarkable incident. Shortly after her return to Dedham, Mrs. Burton wrote a letter to her friend Mrs. Murrey of Lewiston, in which she gave an account of a dream she had had on a certain Sunday night in June, either the very Sunday on which Lizzie had disappeared or very soon thereafter. This letter was subsequently reprinted, in part, in the Lewiston Journal of October 18, 1873 (more than three years after it was written), and from that paper it is reprinted here.</p>
				<p>&quot;It seemed as if I was in Lewiston, on a river road, and near some mills. I did not see any mills but something seemed to say: &quot;There are mills here?' As I was on this road, all at once, I saw a wagon ahead and I said to myself: That is Jim and Lizzie. I wondered they were out there riding together. I seemed to keep along behind them up the road, with the river on one side, and all woods, when Jim turned off the river road into a by-road—into a pasture as it seemed to me-sort of a pasture road. Then I lost sight of them, when they disappeared in a thicket of pines. Then I saw her on the ground and Jim standing over her. She was pleading for her life. I heard her say: 'O, don't murder me!' She was holding up her arm. Then her arm dropped down by her side. She sank down. He had his hand raised up as if to strike her. I tried to get to them, but a thick fog seemed between us. I could see the pines waving over her. They were not large pines, but thick, and she seemed to be lying upon sidling ground.</p>
				<p>&quot;I was greatly frightened by my dream—and it did not seem like a dream. I had been to bed but a little while, and the moon was bright in the room. I did not tell my dream the next morning. I said I had a bad dream, and that I would not tell it then, for the saying was: 'Dream Sunday night and tell it Monday morning it will surely come to pass.' I told it after a little while and I could not keep it out of my mind. Nights, when the wind blows, it wakes me up, and I think it is the sound of the pines over Lizzie. I was worried more because I could not hear from them-could get no answer to my letters.&quot; At the time that Mrs. Burton dreamed this dream, as at the time she wrote the letter recounting it, only one living person had the slightest knowledge of what actually had happened to Lizzie, and that person was not Mrs. Burton. Her friend Mrs. Murrey apparently thought little of the matter—there was no especial reason why she should—and both dream and letter were forgotten for three years. They were finally to be recalled under almost unbelievable circumstances.</p>
				<p>But one more letter is needed to complete the record. About the middle of September, 1870, Mrs. Burton, at home in Dedham, received the usual &quot;few Lines&quot; from her son-in-law.</p>
				<p>Lewiston Sept 5</p>
				<p>Dear muther.</p>
				<p>I thought I would rite you a few Lines to Let you no that I am well and hope these few Lines will find you the Same I had a Leter from Lizza She wanted to nowe if I would Live with her again I dont think will any body done as She has I rote to her yesterday and told her not to rite to me again the Cars was gust going out of the depot wehn I got there I am going away to work</p>
				<p>So good By</p>
				<p>from James M. Lowell</p>
				<p>In answering this Mrs. Burton pleaded with Lowell &quot;if he had any mercy on me to write and tell me where she was,&quot; but Jim Lowell did not write, and it was many a long month before Mrs. Burton was to see or hear from him again.</p>
				<p>The next year rolled by uneventfully. Jim Lowell went about his trucking business, varying the monotony with a series of unimportant amatory adventures. It was never woman but women that interested Jim. Mrs. Burton stayed at home in Dedham. Lewiston was concerned with its growth as an industrial center. Everybody was very much occupied with their own affairs. Lizzie was almost forgotten.</p>
				<p>In the autumn of 1872, Jim Lowell moved from Lewiston to Lawrence, Massachusetts. There he married a local girl, who never came into the picture further than that, continued his trucking business, and, to all appearances, settled down. Lizzie had become a memory and her disappearance a legend.</p>
				<p>In December, 1871, John N. Small of Lewiston bought &quot;a piece of woods.&quot; These woods were situated a little way outside of the town of Lewiston, just above Switzerland Road, where Jim and Lizzie Lowell were last seen together, and comprised a rough triangle of land bounded on one side by a cattle path, on another by a wood road, and on the third by what was known as an accommodation road leading to the uplands. A year after buying this prop-erty, Small, in company with Hiram W. Loring of Lewis-ton, who was joint purchaser, started cutting off the wood. They cut and hauled well into the winter of 1872, when they were blocked by heavy snow, after which they discontinued operations for that season, leaving a quantity of the cut timber on the ground to be taken out the next year.</p>
				<p>On the 15th of October, 1873, John Small took his cart and went back for a load of the wood that had been left the previous season. In order to get the wood to the cart he &quot;had to tote it along a piece from where it lay,&quot; and it was at that moment that he made his great discovery. Bending down under the close-growing pines, the lower boughs of which almost swept the ground, Small noticed two straight lines of spots. Looking closer, he saw that the spots were really buttons, and then he noticed that there was cloth between the two lines. It was almost covered by pine needles and leaves, but he could see it clearly. He could see more.</p>
				<p>Small stood up with a startled gasp. It was a human skeleton that lay there. And then-something unnatural about the bones made John stop and blink. The skeleton had no head.</p>
				<p>John Small didn't disturb what he saw. He went promptly to the road for reinforcements, and a number of passers-by came into the wood-lot and &quot;inspected the remains.&quot; Their comments proved unenlightening, how-ever, and a messenger was dispatched into Lewiston to fetch the city marshal, H. H. Richardson who, on his arrival nearly an hour later, in turn sent back for Ham Brooks, the coroner; and it was not until Mr. Brooks arrived that anything happened.</p>
				<p>Ham Brooks viewed the skeleton with the majesty proper to his office.</p>
				<p>&quot;We will proceed to take the remains up,&quot; said Ham, and this was forthwith done, the coroner remarking somewhat bitterly that there were one or two bones missing.</p>
				<p>And the head—the head was missing too.</p>
				<p>After the grisly rite of removal had been accomplished, Ham Brooks &quot;carried the remains to the city building, Lewiston, and put them in a prisoner's cell.&quot; Another nearby cell was soon to be put to better purpose.</p>
				<p>It is unfortunate that the minutes of the inquest, held that same October afternoon, are not immediately avail-able. If they were, it might be possible to cite the very instant in which a nameless someone identified the headless skeleton, dressed in its rotting garments, as being all that remained of the Lizzie Lowell who had disappeared so strangely three years before. But even before that mo-ment, perhaps even before the skeleton had been moved from its bed beneath the pines, it is probable that &quot;many-tongued rumor&quot; was doing its deadly work in its own deadly way.</p>
				<p>The material evidence of identity was certainly scant enough. The skeleton itself minus the skull, two shoes, the remains of dress materials, some buttons, a corset spring, and the hoop from a skirt were about all that witnesses had to judge from. But there was no hesitation. Lizzie Lowell had been lost and was found.</p>
				<p>New Englanders are, at least in one of their manifestations, not unlike the famous parrot of whom its new owner complained because it either wouldn't or couldn't talk. &quot;Well, ma'am,&quot; replied the dealer, &quot;that there parrot may not talk very much, but it certainly does do the hell of a lot of thinking!&quot; So too with New England. The mere fact that Lizzie Lowell's disappearance had not been more openly discussed by all and sundry was no sign that it had passed without remark or had been forgotten. Indeed, the very fact that Lewiston in general and the coroner's jury in particular at once jumped to the con-clusion, on very slim material evidence, that the remains were those of Lizzie shows how keenly alive their minds were to a case that might have been supposed to have closed three years before.</p>
				<p>In any event, the coroner's jury came to three definite conclusions: First, that the remains were those of the lost Lizzie Lowell (of which there was little evidence); second, that the aforesaid Lizzie Lowell had been murdered (of which there was no evidence at all); and third, that the murder had been committed by &quot;a person or persons un-known&quot; (which remained to be substantiated providing point two were proven to be true). Indeed, the entire verdict was little better than good guesswork, but - jury of inquest is allowed considerable latitude, and it was permitted to pass.</p>
				<p>On the following day, the 16th of October, H. H. Richardson, the city marshal, ordered the arrest of Jim Lowell on the charge of murdering his wife. Supposedly, Lowell was still in Lawrence, Masschusetts, and accordingly E. D. Wiggin, police officer of Lewiston, set out for that city, arriving there on the following day.</p>
				<p>Wiggin found Jim Lowell without any difficulty. At about ten in the morning he stepped out into the road near Lawrence and halted Lowell, who was driving past with his inevitable team. &quot;Good-morning,&quot; said Wiggin, and &quot;Good-morning,&quot; answered Lowell, starting to back up his team to where the other waited. Wiggin asked whether he could see him for a minute, and Lowell stepped down from the wagon. Wiggin said nothing, but handed Lowell a clipping he had cut from that morning's Boston Journal giving a brief description of the finding of the skeleton. Lowell took the clipping in his left hand and glanced at it. His hand began to shake, and he added his right hand to that holding the paper. He dropped his head, shielding his eyes. Wiggin saw his knuckles whiten as his grip on the clipping tightened. Lowell read the story through twice. After waiting a few seconds Wiggin asked, &quot;What do you know about this?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Nothing,&quot; replied Lowell.</p>
				<p>&quot;Where is the head?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;I don't know.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Where is your wife?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Up to the house.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Where is your first wife?&quot;</p>
				<p>Jim said that the last time he had seen Lizzie was on a Sunday, the day after the circus at Lewiston, when he had taken her for a drive at about four o'clock. He hadn't seen her since, and had always supposed she had gone off with the circus. Constable Wiggin went on with his questions.</p>
				<p>&quot;What kind of dress did she have on?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;A light spotted dress.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Did she have a black silk dress?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes, I bought it for her.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Have you heard from her since?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes, once a fellow told me he saw her in New York.&quot; </p>
				<p>But Jim was vague about the &quot;fellow's&quot; name, as he had been in reply to the same question from Mrs. Burton several years before. The man was &quot;John something&quot;-that was all. Wiggin gave up his questions and came to the point.</p>
				<p>&quot;James Lowell, I arrest you for the murder of your wife.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;All right. Where do you want me to go?&quot; </p>
				<p>Wiggin explained that City Marshal Richardson had already started for Augusta, the capital of Maine, to get extradition papers so that Lowell could be removed from Massachusetts, and that Jim would have to stay at the police station in Lawrence until the marshal came. The prisoner said that he was quite willing to waive extradition and go back to Lewiston at once, but Wiggin thought it better to wait, and wait they did. Richardson arrived with the papers that night, and the next morning he and Lowell left on the homeward journey. This was on a Friday, October 18th, and Wiggin, his task accomplished, was left to spend the week-end in Lawrence.</p>
				<p>Before they got on the train Richardson bought the Boston Herald and also the Journal, giving the latter to Lowell and keeping the Herald to read himself. The two read their papers in silence as the slow train puffed its way through the lovely autumnal countryside until they got &quot;just above Exeter.&quot; The Herald had a story on the finding of the body and the results of the inquest and, marking this with his thumb, Richardson passed the paper to Lowell without comment, taking the Journal in ex-change. Jim Lowell read the story so slowly that Richard-son, who was watching him closely, thought that he was going through it a second time. Then Jim put down the paper and looked up.</p>
				<p>&quot;They've got it so it reads pretty well, haven't they?&quot; said he. Richardson agreed. &quot;Well,&quot; continued Jim, &quot;I didn't kill her, and I can prove it. I haven't seen her since the night of the circus.&quot; Now this was a lie and a very useless one, for Jim had already admitted to Wiggin that he had taken Lizzie driving the following day. This being before the days of restaurant cars, the train stopped and gave the passengers &quot;twenty minutes for refreshments,&quot; and after the noon meal the conversation was resumed, this time in the smoking car. Lowell asked Richardson if there was much excitement in Lewiston, and Richardson replied that there was not; that very few people knew what had happened. There he was wrong. Lowell then reverted to his wife (Lizzie), and this time said that he had not seen her since Sunday morning at the time of the fire. This was the third version. The two finished their cigars and moved back into the day coach, where Jim broke out again with:</p>
				<p>&quot;I'm not afraid to go to Lewiston! When I get there I can clear it all up, because I can prove that I have not seen my wife since Sunday night, since I rode out with her.&quot;</p>
				<p>Said Richardson, &quot;Look here, Lowell, I'm going to caution you a little. You're wagging your jaw a little too much. You've told me three stories now. If you're going to get out of this you'll have to tell a straight story.&quot; </p>
				<p>It is quite possible that if Lowell had taken the excellent advice thus offered him the outcome might have been fortunately different.</p>
				<p>About the middle of the afternoon the train pulled in at Auburn, just across the river from Lewiston, and both Richardson and his prisoner were surprised to see a large crowd gathered on the platform.</p>
				<p>&quot;What's all this about?&quot; inquired Lowell suspiciously.</p>
				<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; answered Richardson, &quot;unless it's a big picnic.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Humph!&quot; grunted Lowell grimly. &quot;More likely it's a circus and I'm the elephant!&quot;</p>
				<p>Not knowing the temper of the crowd, and wishing to avoid the possibility of trouble, Richardson left his seat beside Lowell and moved to another part of the car. Everyone knew him, he figured, but not everyone knew Jim. His precaution was immediately justified when Frank L. Dingley, editor of the Lewiston Journal, entered and asked to see the prisoner. Richardson, realizing that Dingley didn't know Lowell by sight, replied that he could see the prisoner if he could pick him out himself. Dingley grinned and settled down to wait for the end of the short run into Lewiston. He knew that his time would come. In those days a good editor was a good reporter too, and Dingley was a good editor.</p>
				<p>It was on this day, October 18th, that the Journal printed the famous &quot;dream letter,&quot; written nearly three years before by Mrs. Burton. Until the finding of the headless skeleton the letter had possessed no especial significance, but after that date it was endowed with all the importance of a latter-day miracle. That its publication was highly prejudicial to the interests of the accused there can be no question, any more than there can be that it was good journalism on Mr. Dingley's part to publish it. The letter was so astounding a forecast of what now appeared to be the truth that its effect was devastating no far as Jim Lowell was concerned.</p>
				<p>Mr. Dingley's patience was rewarded, Richardson permitting him to ride in &quot;the hack&quot; in which Lowell was taken to the jail. At the jail Richardson told Jim that he would &quot;give him the best room in the house. I put him in No. 20.&quot; The indefatigable Mr. Dingley followed them into the jail, and then along the corridor to the cell, where he asked permission to interview the prisoner. Richardson later testified, &quot;I did not know but it would be well to put something in the paper, there was so much excitement just at that time.&quot; Accordingly, he warned Lowell &quot;not to say anything to Mr. Dingley that he did not want to see in print,&quot; and left the two alone together, after admonishing Dingley that he could take any statement that Lowell chose to make, but that he must not ask questions. Touching confidence! On his return he found &quot;Mr. Dingley was questioning him [Lowell] pretty sharp. I told Mr. Dingley that I guessed he had got through with that; that he was not trying that man here, and that he had better go out. He left with what he had.&quot;</p>
				<p>Frank Dingley's interview with Jim Lowell, which duly appeared in the Lewiston Journal, added no new facts to the case. He had gone to the circus with Lizzie on Saturday night, and when &quot;she kept looking at some circus fellows&quot; he was considerably annoyed. He had seen her the next day, Sunday, at the fire. Was that the last time? Yes-no, he had taken her for a drive that same evening, but had brought her back early. And he had never seen her again? No. That was his story, and Jim stuck to it fairly closely.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Burton and Georgia came promptly to Lewiston, and a day or two after Jim's arrest they were admitted to the jail. Richardson unlocked the cell door and said, &quot;I've got some company for you. Your mother and sister-in-law have come to see you.&quot; Lowell neither moved nor spoke. He sat silent, looking down at the floor. Mrs. Burton bustled into the cell with Georgia at her heels. &quot;How do you do, Jim?&quot; said Mrs. Burton, but Jim made no reply. Richardson had brought with him a portion of the dress that had been found on the skeleton. Holding it out, he said, &quot;Jim, did you ever see this dress before?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;No,&quot; replied Jim.</p>
				<p>Mrs. Burton forced the question. &quot;Jim, that is Lizzie's dress, and you know it is!&quot;</p>
				<p>Jim, still looking fixedly at the floor, answered from between his teeth, &quot;No, it is not. Lizzie's dress had fringe on it, and this has lace.&quot;</p>
				<p>Richardson was annoyed. &quot;Jim,&quot; said he, &quot;you don't know what is on this dress, whether it is fringe or what it is. You haven't looked at it.&quot;</p>
				<p>There was a little more give and take, Jim being mostly on the receiving end. Mrs. Burton accused him directly of murdering Lizzie, and he as directly denied it. And then he was left alone. It was all more or less extra-legal, and certainly wasn't calculated to improve Jim's chances. But then—it wasn't supposed to.</p>
				<p>Jim Lowell was arrested on October 17, 1873, and lodged in the Lewiston jail on the 18th, but the Grand Jury did not find a true bill against him until the third Tuesday of January, 1874, and his trial on the indictment did not begin until Tuesday, February 10th, of the same year, just about three years and seven months from the time that Lizzie Lowell had disappeared.</p>
				<p>Meantime, Jim languished in jail. Again and yet again this Don Juan of Androscoggin repeated his several versions of the story of his last sight of Lizzie. From Saturday night and the circus to Sunday night and the final drive his story skipped about like a flea on a hot griddle. An incident that occurred on Christmas Day remains obscure. It was testified to at the trial by W. H. Washburn, turnkey at the jail, but was not elaborated sufficiently to develop its point—if it had any. It seems that at the time Lowell was confined there were also five girls in the jail who occupied what were known as the Debtors' Rooms (rooms in distinction to cells, and with a small hot-air register to heat them). The girls complained of cold, in spite of the register, and on Christmas Day they celebrated by gathering up what scraps of paper they could find, along with the assorted and accumulated waste from the floor, and building a fire in the middle of the room. Washburn, summoned by the smoke, came and moved the girls to a cell; after which he put out the fire, cleared up the mess, and made a search for further inflammables. It was during the course of this search that he found two letters in the pocket of a dress belonging to one, Miss Nellie Garland, the letters being introduced at the subsequent trial as exhibits &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H.&quot; No sooner had Washburn found them than they were claimed by Jim Lowell, but whether they were written to him or by him is not clear. Indeed, the incident appears to have no significance other than showing that there were &quot;goings on&quot; of one sort or another in the prison during the time that Lowell was awaiting trial.</p>
				<p>At ten o'clock on the morning of Tuesday, February 10, 1874, Jim Lowell went on trial on the capital charge before the Supreme Judicial Court of Androscoggin County. The presiding judge was the Hon. Charles W. Walton; the Hon. H. M. Plaisted, attorney general, and George C. Wing, Esq., county attorney, appearing for the state, and the Hon. Eben F. Pillsbury and the Hon. M. I. Ludden for the accused.</p>
				<p>The trial itself was interesting from a special and technical rather than from a sensational angle. As a case resting entirely on circumstantial evidence it is important; but most murders are proven, when they are proven at all, through evidence of this character, because the murderer, of all criminals, is the most unwilling to do his work before witnesses. Other points are much more unusual: the length of time that elapsed between the alleged crime and the discovery of the body of the victim; the difficulty of identifying the remains; the practical impossibility of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the victim died by violence. All these could be developed from a possibility into a probability, but to carry this progression into the final step of a certainty could not, by any legal means, be accomplished. The case has been compared with that of the murder of Dr. Parkman by Professor Webster, but in that instance the remains were found within one week, and identity was established, in part, by means of the teeth. In the Lowell case, however, the skeleton of the deceased was not found until more than three years after the supposed crime, and not only was identification through the teeth impossible, but the entire skull was missing, thus throwing a certain doubt on the exact manner of death. In short, the entire case bristled with an array of those difficulties that are the delight of lawyers and the despair of laymen.</p>
				<p>From the very outset, naturally enough, the bone of contention was the identity of the skeleton. The medical evidence showed that the bones were those of a woman of Lizzie Lowell's approximate age and height, and that they had been lying exposed on the ground for about the length of time that Lizzie had been missing. And that was about all there was to that. On the other hand, the experts, so called, did bring out one fact of considerable significance: The bones of the neck, where the head had been joined to the body, were not scarred, as they must have been had the head been hacked off by an unskilled hand. This fact could be interpreted variously. If the head had not been removed violently from the corpse, it must then have been removed after decomposition had reached the point at which the skull could be detached from the vertebra without scarring. Had this been done by the murderer, returning after a long lapse of time to conceal the one portion of the body that bore traces of his work? If this was so, the killer certainly took a very long chance in waiting as long as he must have done. Either that, or he was extraordinarily absent-minded in not thinking of this obvious precaution sooner. A dare-devil or a fool— which? Also—if it was the murderer who took away the skull, why did he not also take the betraying clothes? Indeed, why did he not bury the whole ghastly business and have done with it? Having asked these and other pointed questions, the defense suggested that the missing head had been stolen by some prowling animal, a fox, perhaps, which would readily explain the whole affair. The defense may have been quite right. The whole truth as to the missing head is not known to this day, although something that happened after the trial did throw rather more light on the question.</p>
				<p>The skeleton having told its story, the clothes, shoes, buttons, and small ornaments that had been found on or near it were called on for testimony. The ground here was more firm. Women in Lizzie Lowell's station in life, living in a provincial town, do not usually have an extensive wardrobe; and what there is of it is, usually, of local manu-facture. The testimony in this connection would be interesting only to a specialist in women's dress at a period when it was almost as ugly as men's clothes are today. There was much talk of &quot;a black silk sacque, trimmed around the bottom with lace and a piece of fringe,&quot; laced boots, made of serge with cloth tips, a skirt that was fitted to the waist by being plaited in front and gathered behind, of the relative merits of silk and cotton thread in dress-making, of gores, machine and hand sewing, and a thousand and one technical details which, however greatly they may have interested the ladies present, must have sorely bored and puzzled the jury. In any event, the state was able to prove, at least beyond all reasonable doubt, that the garments that clothed the skeleton were the same as those that had clothed Lizzie Lowell the last time she had been seen.</p>
				<p>And then the letters, the ones from Jim to Mrs. Burton, and still more those that purported to come from Lizzie herself after her disappearance. Nearly all of them have been given here, and the reader, except for the facts of handwriting, can be his own judge. At the outset it was very clear that whoever wrote the letters was illiterate to the point of unintelligibility. It was difficult even to find the same errors made twice in the same way. In the end, however, it became clear that the prisoner had written them all, and the net, which had been steadily drawing closer, now was almost tight.</p>
				<p>At last the state closed its case, having done an exceedingly able job, and sat back to see what the defense could make of it. It couldn't make much. It simply didn't have the materials. Not that Lowell's attorneys didn't fight hard and well, because they did, but they lacked the concrete stuff of which successful murder defenses are made. They denied that the skeleton was that of Lizzie Lowell, and they unwisely attempted to prove their denial. They denied that the clothes and other adjuncts belonged to her, but the evidence was straight against them. If the corpse was not Lizzie's, certainly Lizzie's husband could not be tried for her murder. Then where was Lizzie? Just where Jim Lowell had always said she was-departed with a &quot;circus feller&quot; for parts unknown.</p>
				<p>Suddenly, on the seventh day of the trial, the defense sprang a surprise witness in support of this amazing con-tention. Whether Lizzie had or had not run off with the circus on the Sunday morning after the last performance, there was at least one person in town who had; and who had now come back to tell all about it. This was young Wilmot Nelson, aged twenty at the time of the trial and, hence, about seventeen when he was chore-boy at the DeWitt House in Lewiston on that eventful night in 1870. Wilmot deposed that on the night the circus closed, Saturday night, he had seen Lizzie Lowell in a room on the second or third floor of the DeWitt House in company with another woman and two men, all circus people, and that he, Wilmot, had supplied them with liquor (Maine being dry at the time). After setting this compromising scene, Wilmot further testified that he had slept with one of the circus men who had offered him a job, and that in accord with this agreement he had left with the circus the next morning, continuing in its employ until it had broken up in Providence. Now the circus, as so often happens when a road show makes a jump over a week-end, had left Lewiston in two sections: the first on Sunday, and the second early on Monday morning. Wilmot's version was that he traveled with the second group, and that he saw Lizzie Lowell standing on a car platform as he himself got on the train. If this was true, Lizzie certainly was not murdered on Sunday night, for she appears to have left with the circus Monday morning. Not content with this, Wilmot went on to say that during the course of his occupation as candy butcher with the circus he saw Lizzie Lowell again, this time in the ladies' dressing room at Hyde Park. All these facts, and a few others of less significance, he had communicated to Constable Wiggin at Lawrence not long before the trial. Here was a staggerer! But was it? If there was the slightest chance that Wilmot Nelson was mistaken in his identification of Lizzie Lowell, his entire testimony fell to the ground. Supporting evidence was impossible to obtain. The Great Australian Circus of three years before had broken up and was scattered to the winds. Wilmot Nelson had made a statement on oath of the greatest possible importance, and it was a statement that he himself clearly believed. But there was no conceivable way by which it could be corroborated. All that could be done was to send it to the jury and let them make what they could of it. They did. They threw it out. Wilmot must have been mistaken.</p>
				<p>And so the trial of Jim Lowell for the murder of his wife Lizzie dragged its length through ten February days. It was fair, so far as any such trial in any such community could be, but the defense was clearly handicapped by the fact that most of the community believed Lowell guilty and had from the very outset.</p>
				<p>On Wednesday, February 18th, it was generally expected that the case would go to the jury by the following day. That evening, when Lowell returned to the jail, he was jubilant. It is not too much to say that he frisked.</p>
				<p>&quot;I shall be a free man tomorrow!&quot; said he. &quot;The attorney general can't say anything against me.&quot;</p>
				<p>He didn't know his man. When the attorney general began his speech on Thursday morning one could see the confidence running out of the prisoner as water from a sprung bucket. During the charge of the judge, Lowell listened quietly, almost as if he were stunned. At six thirty-five that afternoon, the jury retired, and Lowell was taken back to the jail, where he ate little.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, in Lewiston and Auburn, little was discussed except the outcome of the trial. The street corners of New England towns do not offer many attractions on a bitter February evening, but one imagines them filled with little knots of townspeople on this particular occasion: great-coated men slapping their arms vigorously and stamping their feet to warm them as they argued as to whether or not &quot;that wuthless Jim Lowell did in Lizzie.&quot; And then, one may be sure, someone would sing out, &quot;But the head! What did he do with the head?&quot; Above all other points, however, that were discussed that blustery night, as the jury bickered snugly in their comfortable quarters in the Court House, was the ever-famous one of the letter, Mrs. Burton's letter, the letter of prophecy of three years before, to disbelieve in which would be almost as great a blasphemy as to try to throw discredit on the miracle of Jonah and the whale.</p>
				<p>At a little after ten the word went round that the jury was ready with its verdict, and at twenty minutes past the hour Jim Lowell stood at the bar. The jury was polled and announced its verdict: MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE.</p>
				<p>Lowell was taken back to the jail and, according to his own account, slept well that night (a very usual phenomenom for a convicted murderer on the first night after the verdict). The next day, &quot;I fell asleep in half an hour after I came back to jail,&quot; said he.</p>
				<p>&quot;Was the verdict a surprise to you?&quot; questioned the jailer.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Lowell gloomily, &quot;I didn't expect it.&quot; </p>
				<p>That noon his wife, with whom he had been living in Lawrence, came to see him, and after a long interview she left in tears.</p>
				<p>It was on this day too, the 20th, that the court granted delay of sentence in order to permit the defense to draw up a bill of exceptions. Not until the 6th of May, 1874, surely a long wait, was the convicted man brought before the court for formal sentence. His attorneys had withdrawn their exceptions. And then Jim Lowell was sentenced to be hanged.</p>
				<p>But the Maine law at that time was peculiar.</p>
				<p>In pronouncing sentence, Judge Walton said in part:</p>
				<p>&quot;'...that you, James M. Lowell, be removed from this place to the State Prison at Thomaston, in the County of Knox; that within the walls, or enclosed yard, of said prison, at such time after the expiration of one year from this day, as the supreme executive authority of this State, by a warrant under the great seal thereof, shall direct, you be hung by the neck till you are dead; and that you be kept in confinement in said prison till this sentence of death shall be inflicted upon you.'&quot;</p>
				<p>This curious delay of a year between sentence and execution was provided for by a Maine statute which necessitated a review by the governor and council, not only of the evidence in such cases, but of the complete record. After this review had been made the governor could order the sentence carried out or could direct its commutation. Clearly, this wise provision foreshadowed the day, not far distant, when Maine would abolish capital punishment altogether, and in Lowell's case it was altogether justified. At the expiration of the given period, the governor commuted the sentence, and Jim Lowell was committed to jail for life.</p>
				<p>That this action was justified became clear when Jim Lowell, talkative to the last, made his confession, for while his statement cannot be proven true, at least it covers the facts. If he had made it at the very outset, instead of trying to cover his tracks by a network of stupid lies, it is probable enough that he would never have been indicted for a worse offense than manslaughter. For Jim said that he and Lizzie had quarreled that Sunday evening as they drove together up by Switzerland Road, and that in the course of the quarrel he had pushed Lizzie out of the wagon, and that Lizzie, in falling, had broken her neck. It was very probably true. For one thing it accounted for the fact that the missing head had, apparently, not been cut from the body but, the vertebra being already dislocated, had rolled away of its own accord, leaving no telltale scars. And then-Jim Lowell was a man who would be more likely to threaten than to kill.</p>
				<p>Sometime during the decade that marks the 1920's, Jim Lowell was released from prison, after having served more than forty years. After that he is to be seen no more.</p>
				<p>And Androscoggin County, Maine, after her own inimitable manner, has gone right along minding her own business.</p>

				<head type="chapter">THE BLOODHOUND OF FATE</head>
				<p>FATE is proverbially an amazing stage manager, as she is the most daring of playwrights. She will write and stage a scene that appears to be quite unimportant, but in the last act, because of that scene, a throne will totter or a head will fall.</p>
				<p>So it was that when young Count Kurt von Hohenstaufen, on an evening in 1857, found Thomas Neumann dying of hunger and fatigue in the dark and narrow streets of Bamberg, a city of old Bavaria, he forged the first link in a chain that, nineteen years later, was to deprive one man of his liberty and another of his life.</p>
				<p>Young Kurt, he was only fifteen at the time, took Neumann to his father's estate on the outskirts of the city, fed and clothed him, and had him appointed one of Count Kuno's foresters. Neumann's life was saved and, more than that, from a vagrant he became a man of substance. Neumann was passionately grateful and dedicated his future life to the service of his benefactor. The result of his gratitude is one of the most remarkable stories in the history of crime.</p>
				<p>Trouble was brewing in the ancient house of Von Hohenstaufen. The mediæval castle that reared its battlements high above the quaint shops and houses of Bamberg was well able to repel the invader, as it had done often enough in times long past, but it could not keep out trouble from within. Two years before, in 1855, Count Kuno had married for the second time and, as so often happens, his only son Kurt had bitterly resented an act which put another in the place he considered should be held sacred to the memory of his mother. Whether there was any material cause for this resentment is not known and does not now matter. The breach widened, until in 1858, the year after our story opens, Kurt, now sixteen, determined to seek his fortune elsewhere. And elsewhere, in his case, as in so many others, meant only America.</p>
				<p>Count Kuno, who was evidently a kindly man and an affectionate father, did his best to dissuade the boy, but having failed to do so, prepared to take the matter philo-sophically. He was insistent only on one point. Some time before this, Kurt had struck up an acquaintance with one Diedrich Neumann—not to be confused with Thomas, the forester, with whom he had no connection-and this acquaintance had ripened until Diedrich and Kurt were the closest of friends. As a matter of fact, they were about the same age and even looked not unlike each other. These were the only two points of similarity between them, however, for while Kurt was open and generous, Diedrich was, or seemed to the Count, both sly and sinister. Kurt now proposed to take Diedrich with him on his American adventure, a step of which his father violently disapproved. Diedrich was bad enough on the spot, in his opinion, but as his son's only friend in a strange country he was out of the question. Still, there was nothing he could charge directly against Neumann. It was only his manner that made the Count uneasy; that and certain minor characteristics that seemed to indicate the possibility of something malign under his somewhat too sleek exterior. But—Kurt might be right after all. The Count capitulated, perhaps influenced by the natural desire for peace in his household, blessed his son, gave him means of identification and of proving his title to the estates in the event of need, settled an allowance on him, and bade him godspeed.</p>
				<p>Before the two young men started on their journey, however, something happened that was to have a far-reaching effect. Thomas, the forester, devoted to his young master, requested that he be taken along as Kurt's personal servant. He too disliked and distrusted Diedrich Neumann. Kurt laughed at him. They would have no need for a personal servant in America, and Thomas had best stay at home. Whereupon Thomas said nothing but went to Count Kuno.</p>
				<p>The Count and the forester, who was then a man of about thirty, put their heads together quite frankly. They agreed that to let a sixteen-year-old boy, the heir to large estates, go off to America with a companion in whom, to say the least, they felt no especial confidence, was out of the question. Thomas suggested that he follow the pair in secret, keep an eye on them, and lend a hand in the event of trouble. This was satisfactory to the Count, who, further, extracted from Thomas a promise that he would write at intervals and report on the progress that Kurt was making.</p>
				<p>The next day Thomas was sent off, ostensibly on a mission for the Count, in reality to give him a twenty-four-hour start on the two who were to follow. Thomas went at once to Hamburg and, armed with a letter of introduction from the Count, made his way direct to the master of the ship on which Kurt and Diedrich were to sail. The shipmaster readily agreed that Thomas should pay half fare and should be given the position of assistant steward, his duties being to serve the meals to the five hundred steerage passengers who were on board. This kept him out of the way of the first cabin and, consequently, of the two young men.</p>
				<p>The day that Thomas entered on his new duties was also the day on which Kurt and Diedrich were to leave Bamberg. Kurt called in the carriage for his friend, and they then stopped at the castle to say their formal fare-wells. The Count, but not the Countess, it appears, came out to them, bringing with him Kurt's stepsister, a little girl of three years. There were more blessings, a few tears, and the two adventurers were away upon their journey. Arriving in Hamburg, they had to wait a day before the ship sailed, but on the next day Thomas had the satisfaction of seeing them safe on board but without being seen by them.</p>
				<p>The voyage was uneventful, though doubtless to the two youngsters, crossing the Atlantic on a sailing ship for the first time, it was sufficiently romantic to compensate for its length. In due course the ship entered New York harbor, passed the place where the Statue of Liberty was later to stand, and docked. Kurt and his companion decided to spend a day or two in New York arranging their financial affairs with the Count's bankers, before proceeding to Cleveland, their next port of call.</p>
				<p>Thomas now decided to take a step that seemed to him expedient, though he was perfectly alive to its possibilities for trouble. Waiting until Diedrich was out of the way, he sent a message to Kurt asking for an interview. It was granted, and all went well. Kurt, who seems to have been a good-natured lad, was more amused than angered at Thomas's espionage, and promised faithfully, though laughingly, not to let Diedrich know of the forester's presence. Fortunately, he kept this promise to the letter. On his part, Thomas assured Kurt that he would shift for himself, mind his own business, within reason, and present no obstacle to Kurt's perfect freedom. Kurt further promised to keep Thomas informed of their plans.</p>
				<p>&quot;At the outset,&quot; said he, &quot;I can tell you that, four days from now, we intend to start for Cleveland, and according to advice that we have had, we shall stay at the Weddell House there.&quot;</p>
				<p>The next day Thomas started for Cleveland, managed to get a job as night porter at the Weddell House and, three days later, had the pleasure of seeing Kurt and Diedrich step from the omnibus and take up their quarters in the hotel.</p>
				<p>The two young men had talked the matter over and had decided that it would be best for them to head for St. Louis. That city had a large German population, as it has today, and with their recommendations, their chances of getting good positions would be better than elsewhere. Accordingly, in a day or two, they left Ohio for Missouri, Kurt having had several secret interviews with Thomas, who, for the moment, remained behind.</p>
				<p>From their first landing on American soil, both Kurt and Diedrich had spent their money freely, so freely, in fact, that Diedrich had very soon run through his and had fallen back on his friend, who was better supplied. He then spent Kurt's money as freely as he had spent his own, and Kurt soon saw that they would have to get work in short order, if anything was to be left of his yearly allowance.</p>
				<p>In St. Louis, luck was with them. The name, Von Hohenstaufen, still meant something to the German colony there, and Kurt, who spoke three languages Hu-ently, soon found a good position in one of the leading wholesale drygoods houses. There he started as a clerk, but with the prospect of an ultimate partnership. Diedrich found a place in another drygoods house, and while his position was not quite as good as Kurt's, for he was not as good a man, the salary was enough for him to live on comfortably. The start was made.</p>
				<p>Within the first few weeks of his residence in St. Louis, Kurt had many occasions to go to the Planters' House on Fourth Street, which was then and for many years after the meeting place for the merchants of the city. It was within its sacred precincts that the famous Planters' Punch was born, and if the mint julep was not actually invented there, at least it was drunk in large quantities. Meeting the proprietor, Kurt put in a plea for Thomas, who was still portering in Cleveland, and without any difficulty got him a similar place with the Planters'. Thomas came on, and the three were established.</p>
				<p>Not many weeks passed before something happened that was to have a crucial effect on the lives of the trio. Kurt wrote to his father, the Count, announcing his good fortune, and the Count replied in an affectionate letter, one portion of which, however, infuriated his son. Count Kuno said that now he was able to make his own way, it seemed to him that it would be better for Kurt if his yearly allowance were cut in half. He would have ample left to live on, and he would be more nearly standing on his own legs. It was a perfectly reasonable statement, from a father's standpoint, but a violently unreasonable one from that of a son. Kurt was furious and did not even reply to the letter. If Kurt was proud, so was his father, and all correspondence between them was discontinued forthwith. The Countess could hardly have been expected to write, and there was no one else to do so, so that Kurt was entirely cut off from his family very shortly after beginning life in the New World. Fate had driven in another nail.</p>
				<p>Of the life these three lived in St. Louis during the next few years, little or nothing is known. The city was seething with political unrest. The Civil War was at hand, and the Southern planters, the aristocracy of the city, ranged themselves against the commercial interests which, for the most part, favored the Northern side. The German element was almost solidly for the Union, and hundreds of them were drilling in secret for the day they saw coming.</p>
				<p>Winston Churchill has drawn an unforgettable picture of the scene at just this time in his novel, The Crisis, and it was against this background that our actors played their parts. Kurt, Diedrich, and Thomas were in this, but they seem, curiously, not to have been of it. When the war finally came in '61, none of them enlisted, whether for good reasons or for bad. Instead, they stayed at home and profited by the increase in war-time salaries.</p>
				<p>The war dragged through its four long years of agony and passed. The years rolled by. Kurt rose rapidly in the drygoods house, and Diedrich likewise did well. Presently, Kurt was wearing side whiskers and a mustache, while Diedrich cultivated a full beard. Such were the outward signs of prosperity. Thomas, growing a trifle gray now, continued with the Planters' House and saved his money.</p>
				<p>He must have felt that his suspicions of Diedrich had been a little foolish, if he thought about it at all. One of the most unaccountable aspects of the story is that at this period Thomas seems to have entirely forgotten his original purpose in coming to America and his arrangement with Count Kuno to make regular reports. The years had dulled suspicion, and Thomas too had lost touch with the homeland. If he had not—!</p>
				<p>Eighteen years went by. It was the April of 1877.</p>
				<p>Summer is likely to come early in St. Louis, and the April of '77 was hot and humid. Kurt, now a man of thirty-four, had been feeling ill for several days. Meeting Diedrich for lunch at the Planters' House —the two had kept up their friendship all these years-Kurt complained, and Diedrich, reasonably enough, advised a short vacation in a better climate. Further, he offered to go with his friend, who did not seem well enough to travel alone. Accordingly, two days later, the pair left for Alton, Illinois, the scene, in 1837, just forty years before, of the murder by a mob of the Rev. Elijah P. Lovejoy, who held unpopular views on the question of slavery and who insisted on expressing them in public. Alton is about twenty miles from St. Louis, on the other side of the river. Leave of absence had been given both men, and they prepared to stay for some time.</p>
				<p>Diedrich had, as a matter of fact, been far from ingenuous in his suggestion that they go away together. It so happened that Kurt's sudden illness fitted in perfectly with a vague plan that had just come to him. On the day before, Diedrich had taken up a copy of the New York Herald and, on glancing through it, had come upon the following item in the Personals: Countess Unica von Hohenstaufen begs Count Kurt von Hohenstaufen to return at once to his fatherland, where his estates are waiting for the rightful heir.</p>
				<p>Diedrich said nothing to Kurt, and waited to see whether he had noticed the item. Apparently, Kurt had not seen it, for he made no mention of it, and Diedrich proceeded to act. Luring Kurt to Alton was the first step.</p>
				<p>There can be few more remarkable sequences of events in the history of crime. Eighteen years before both Count Kuno and Thomas had distrusted Diedrich and had feared his relationship with Kurt. And yet, during the whole course of that eighteen years there seems to have been nothing actually to justify that suspicion. Diedrich makes no move, and does not, so far as is known, even contemplate crime. Thomas forgets. The watchdog is asleep. And yet, at the end of this period, as if a clock had struck, with no preliminary move to indicate his intention, Died-rich justifies the original suspicion—and lifts his hand.</p>
				<p>Arriving in Alton, Kurt promptly went to bed, leaving to Diedrich the task of registering and making all arrangements with the hotel. The next morning the patient's condition was improved, and he told Diedrich that he thought a few days' rest would put him on his feet again. Mentally resolving otherwise, Diedrich congratulated his friend, and a conversation ensued that marked the next step in the intrigue.</p>
				<p>&quot;Do you ever hear from your family now?&quot; asked Diedrich.</p>
				<p>&quot;No,&quot; anwered Kurt, and explained why.</p>
				<p>&quot;Then you're not even sure your father is alive?&quot; was the next cautious query.</p>
				<p>&quot;I don't know. I've never heard anything to the contrary. I suppose if he were dead I'd have heard from our minister in Washington.&quot;</p>
				<p>Diedrich's eyes shone. He was right. Kurt had not seen the clipping from the Herald. He pushed ahead.</p>
				<p>&quot;But,&quot; he continued, &quot;supposing that your father does die. Your stepmother won't be very eager to give you your property. Can you prove your identity and all that sort of thing?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; answered the victim. &quot;There in my trunk I have all the papers that my father gave me before I left for America. I always carry them with me. They were drawn up by our family lawyer and cover the whole situation.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;May I see them?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Certainly. They're in the red portfolio, lying on top of my letters. Here's the key of the trunk.&quot; Diedrich opened the trunk, found the red portfolio, and went carefully over the papers inside it. Then he said, &quot;They look all right to me, but if I were in your place I'd have them looked over by a German lawyer in this country, so that if anything in them has to be altered, it can be done before it's too late. Suppose I take them up to St. Louis with me tomorrow? I'm going up on the boat and coming back in the evening. I could easily drop in at a German lawyer's office and make a sure thing of it.&quot; </p>
				<p>Kurt agreed. He was too ill to care.</p>
				<p>Diedrich put the papers in his pocket.</p>
				<p>He had registered himself at the hotel as Count von Hohenstaufen, and he now had the means to prove it!</p>
				<p>When Neumann returned from St. Louis, he found Kurt much worse, and nothing was said about the red portfolio.</p>
				<p>Kurt wanted a doctor, but Diedrich persuaded him to wait until the next day in the hope that he might be better.</p>
				<p>The next day, however, Kurt's illness had increased. His head ached fearfully, and several times he lapsed into a partial coma. A doctor now became imperative. Diedrich had been out reconnoitering the evening before, and had located a man who seemed to fit his distinctly peculiar needs. The physician was naturally stupid and, in addition, was a drunkard. He was sent for at once.</p>
				<p>The doctor came and was taken to the room by a hotel waiter, whom Diedrich requested to remain during the examination, probably giving the excuse that it would be easier for the man to stay and show the doctor out rather than to come all the way back after him. What Neumann really wanted, however, was an unbiased witness, and the waiter served admirably. The examination was superficial, naturally, and the diagnosis was an advanced stage of cerebral congestion-which means just about whatever one wants it to mean. The doctor said that he feared for the worst, but that he would do all that was possible. Accordingly, he wrote a prescription which, when used later in the day, seemed to bring relief. Nevertheless, Kurt grew rapidly worse, though he seemed to suffer less. Three days later he was dead.</p>
				<p>There seemed to be nothing out of the way. The doctor gave a certificate stating that the patient had died of acute congestion of the brain, and no one had any reason to suspect that he was wrong. Count Kurt von Hohenstaufen was buried forthwith under the name of Diedrich Neumann.</p>
				<p>Immediately after the funeral, which for some reason took place in Alton, the real Neumann shaved off his chin beard, leaving a pair of flowing whiskers to frame his face. He now looked not at all unlike the man he had just buried. Next, he went back to St. Louis, taking the Count's baggage with him, and presented himself at the mercantile house where Kurt had been employed. Here, he appeared in his actual person, as Diedrich Neumann. He explained to Kurt's employers that the Count had died suddenly, and that he had come to settle his friend's affairs, as he himself intended to leave at once for Germany to take the sad news to the family and deliver into their hands whatever was left by the deceased. The firm willingly paid him the amount due to Kurt and expressed their deep regret at the loss of a trusted employee. In coming to the firm in his own name, Diedrich had made a bad move and one that he was to have reason to regret.</p>
				<p>While all this had been going on, Fate had been setting other machinery in motion. Shortly after the departure of the two friends for Alton, Thomas, in his turn, had seen the personal in the Herald. He at once sent a letter to Kurt, to which he received no reply, although he had every reason to expect a prompt one. Thomas resolved to take his message by hand. He got a day's leave of absence and went up the river to Alton.</p>
				<p>When Thomas got to the hotel and heard that Neumann was dead and buried and that the Count had left, he scented trouble. If the Count had left, the chances were that he had returned to St. Louis and Thomas had not seen him there. Further, when the two men left the city, it was the Count who was ill and not Neumann. Suspicion of Neumann and protection of the Count, though they might be dormant for a very long time, really assumed the proportions of a career with Thomas. They were automatic. He made discreet inquiries, got descriptions of the man who was buried and the man who had buried him, and satisfied himself of the truth of the affair.</p>
				<p>The forester, now an exporter, left Alton for St. Louis and went at once to Kurt's firm. Here he discovered that Neumann had been before him with news of the Count's death and of his own departure. He also heard that Neumann had shaved his beard. The man's heart sank. He was forty-eight, and for eighteen years he had borne a self-imposed trust to watch over the man who had saved his life so long ago. And now-he had failed. It had all come to nothing. The Count was dead, and by the hand of the man whom he, Thomas, had always suspected. Thomas promised himself that if Kurt was dead he would be re-venged.</p>
				<p>Drawing his savings from the bank and hurriedly packing his few belongings, Thomas left for New York. He knew that Neumann would sail from there. Once arrived, he looked over the passenger lists of all the outgoing steamers, and finally, after a long search, found the name Von Hohenstaufen, signed in a strange hand. The steamer was to leave for Germany in two days. Thomas went to a sailors' boarding house, got himself a nautical outfit, and managed to have himself shipped on the same boat that Neumann was taking. The exporter was to have his passage in exchange for his work. He had small fear that Neumann would know him, for the bogus Count had never once set eyes on him since leaving Germany, nearly twenty years before. Early in the game it had become a fixed habit with him to conceal himself from Neumann, and Kurt had never broken his promise of silence. If Neumann had changed in all these years, Thomas had changed like-wise. So Thomas joined the ship, and in two days they sailed, with Neumann on board. Had he known that Nemesis walked the same deck with him, Neumann might have been less easy.</p>
				<p>For the most part, the voyage was uneventful. One thing did happen, however, that was of vital consequence in all that was to follow.</p>
				<p>On the way over, Thomas scraped up an acquaintance, which soon grew into a friendship, with a young woman named Alice Vogel, who was returning to her native city after having been in America as governess. That city was Bamberg, Thomas's home town, as it was that of Kurt and Diedrich, and this naturally brought the two closer together. One day, in a fit of depression, Thomas took Alice Vogel to one side and told her the whole story of what had happened in Alton and St. Louis, with all that led up to it. He swore her to secrecy and said that after he had unmasked Neumann he intended to retire on his savings and live out his life quietly at home. Alice fully sympathized with him and promised to give what help she could. It was more than either of them suspected at the time.</p>
				<p>On May 15, 1877, the boat docked at Hamburg, and the passengers went ashore, Thomas and Alice Vogel together, Neumann alone. At the railroad station the two went into the refreshment bar or restaurant, and there Thomas was able to point out Neumann to Alice and to identify him beyond all question. Alice had never seen the man before, as she had traveled steerage, and he, first cabin. The train came in. Neumann went into a first-class carriage for Bamberg, and Alice and Thomas took their places in a second-class coach on the same train.</p>
				<p>We are now able to follow events with great closeness, for from this point on every detail of the drama was later traced by the German detective, Friedrich Mayer.</p>
				<p>When Neumann stepped into the train, he found in his coach a young lady, very pretty and exceedingly well dressed. He at once apologized for his intrusion and begged permission to share the compartment with her. This was granted, the permission being accompanied by a smile and a lowering of lashes. Neumann was encouraged. The train started, and a conversation took place which was later testified to.</p>
				<p>&quot;You too are going to Bamberg?&quot; asked Neumann.</p>
				<p>&quot;Then we shall be company for one another. Permit me to introduce myself—Count Kurt von Hohenstaufen.&quot; </p>
				<p>Startled, the lady looked at him wide eyed. &quot;Did I understand you properly?&quot; said she. &quot;You are Count Kurt von Hohenstaufen?&quot;</p>
				<p>Neumann laughed. &quot;It's natural that you should be astonished,&quot; said he. &quot;I have not been in my fatherland for a very long time.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes, as long an I can remember.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Almost eighteen years.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;What a strange meeting this is! You must know my name. I am Flora Romberg. My father is your banker.&quot; </p>
				<p>Neumann bowed, and his eyes narrowed. Here was luck indeed.</p>
				<p>&quot;You can probably tell me a great deal of news from home,&quot; he remarked casually.</p>
				<p>The lady could and did. During the long hours of the journey south from Hamburg to Bamberg, Neumann drew her out little by little, getting invaluable details of family life and relationships. He was flattering and gracious, and long before they reached their destination he was not only possessed of a mass of priceless information, but he had an advocate who would spread the news of his arrival with not the slightest thought that he was not all that he claimed to be. As a boy, Neumann had never been able to mix with the circle that included the Rombergs and Von Hohenstaufens, in spite of his friendship with young Kurt, and the data that he drew adroitly from Miss Romberg were a veritable godsend.</p>
				<p>The train finally pulled in at Bamberg, and the passengers alighted, Neumann and Miss Romberg from their compartment, and Thomas and Alice Vogel from theirs. Miss Romberg was met by her brother, whom she presented to the sham Count, who then got into the carriage that was waiting for him and drove to the castle. Thomas and Alice saw him off before they went their way to the Vogels, who insisted on Thomas making his temporary home with them.</p>
				<p>Neumann was accepted at the castle without question. The young Countess Unica, tall and fair, with blue eyes, greeted him with warm sisterly affection, and the single servant left who had known the real Count as a boy was entirely deceived. The Countess Unica and Neumann dined together and after dinner went into the old Count's study, where Unica took two papers from the desk and gave them to the impostor.</p>
				<p>One of these papers was a letter to Kurt, couched in the most affectionate terms, while the other was Count Kuno's will. By this document Kurt was announced as the heir to the estate and all that belonged to it, and to one third of the personal property, the other two thirds going to the Countess Unica. As Unica's share amounted to about one million thalers, Neumann was left with approximately half a million in hand. So far all was well. The Countess bade her supposed brother good-night, and both went to their rooms. Neumann was smug. It had been almost too easy.</p>
				<p>The next morning dawned clear and fair, but there were clouds of another nature on the horizon. Even before he had finished dressing for breakfast, a servant came to Neumann's room and announced that a sailor was at the door who was insistent on seeing him. He had been told to come back later, but had said that he would wait. Indeed, the servant who announced his presence to Neumann quoted him as saying, &quot;For your master's sake, do as I tell you. If you do not, it will be the worse for him.&quot; Neumann was startled. He well knew what thin ice he was treading on and dreaded the moment when it might crack under him, Still, there seemed nothing to fear from a sailor. He seemed to recall having noticed a man in sailor's clothes at the station at Hamburg and again at Bamberg, but the fact meant nothing to him. Undoubtedly, however, it was best to be prepared. He went to a bureau and took something from a drawer. Looking out of his bedroom window, he saw the sailor walking in the castle park and recognized him as the man he had seen getting off the train. It might mean everything or nothing. Neumann went down the stairs and out into the park, telling the servant that he would breakfast when he came back. He was seen to meet the sailor and walk away with him.</p>
				<p>It was about an hour later that Neumann returned alone, rather paler than before, and breakfasted with the Countess. She remarked that he looked ill and suggested that he spend the day at home, to which he replied that it was nothing and that business came first. It certainly did with Neumann! Accordingly, the two drove to the bankers, the Rombergs, where Neumann was welcomed effusively as the Count von Hohenstaufen. Continuing his policy of flattery with entire success, Neumann completed the business of taking over the estate, managed to convey the deep impression that Miss Flora had made on him the day before, rejoined the Countess, and returned to the castle.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, what of Thomas? He had left the Vogels' house early that morning to go to the castle, only Alice knew on what errand, and had not returned. By evening Alice Vogel was uneasy, and by the next morning they were all frankly worried. Vogel, a prosperous tradesman, sent one of his clerks to the castle to make inquiries. On the way, however, this clerk met Konrad Rost, an uncle of Thomas's, and explained his mission. Rost dissuaded him from going further and went back with him to the Vogels'. Here he said that he had met Thomas the morning before, and that Thomas had promised to take supper with him the same evening. He had not appeared for supper, however, and the last Rost had seen of him was when Thomas entered the castle grounds, a few minutes after their conversation. Alice now decided that she must speak. She took her brother into the next room and told him Thomas's story and his errand of revenge.</p>
				<p>Rejoining the family, it was concluded that the best thing to do was to set the police on the trail, but without letting them know the secret facts of the case. These would be told only when it seemed certain that misfortune had overtaken Thomas. The police were forthwith informed of Thomas's strange disappearance, and the case was put in the hands of Detective Mayer. As Mayer is the only person able to give a first-hand account of what followed, it is best to let him tell his own story.</p>
				<p>On the 18th of June, the brothers Vogel requested the police to trace a sailor, Thomas Neumann, who had disappeared, and, as they asserted, it was impossible to account for it in his general conduct. He was a sober, domestic man, and it could not be thought that he would go on a spree. The details of his visit to the castle were related. Of course, when the Chief put the matter into my hands, I had not the slightest idea but that the sailor would be easily found, and therefore I sent messages to the neighboring villages and towns, asking the police to look out for a man of that description. My next move was to go to the castle and have an interview with Count von Hohenstaufen. The Count was, at the beginning, very polite, answering all my questions with the greatest readiness and asserting that the sailor, who had rendered him some services during his journey, had come to remind him of them. He had rewarded the man with some money, and the sailor had said, in a jovial tone, that he intended to go and see some friends. He had then taken leave of him. But when I pushed my questions further, the Count became angry and exclaimed:</p>
				<p>&quot;After all, what have I to do with this sailor? You may look for the sailor wherever you like, and I hope that you will soon find him. I hope that you do not think that I have kept him here as a guest in my castle!&quot;</p>
				<p>Seeing that nothing more could be done by talking and that the Count evidently knew nothing about the man, and not having the slightest idea that a crime had been committed, I took my leave and went back to Mr. Vogel's house. I told him of my reception at the castle. He meditated for a while, and then stood up and said:</p>
				<p>&quot;Excuse me for a minute, I am going to call my sister.&quot; </p>
				<p>He left the room, and soon afterwards the two brothers and Alice Vogel returned. The older Mr. Vogel requested Alice to tell me all that the sailor had entrusted to her, as he now thought that it was necessary that I should know all the facts.</p>
				<p>Alice hesitated, but at last told me the whole story, just as the sailor had told her, of the sudden death of the Count Kurt in America, and of the reappearance of the Count in Bamberg. I told her that I was only sorry she had not spoken before. Furnished with this important information, I went to the Chief and obtained a writ to search the castle and the park.</p>
				<p>I went at once to the castle. The old servant, Daniel, was in the hall. I told him who I was, and commanded him, in the name of the law, to tell me all about the visit of the sailor. He did so, and now, knowing that if a crime had been committed it had been done in the park, I told him to announce me to the Count.</p>
				<p>Daniel went to the room where the Count was. I followed at his heels. He opened the door, and I saw the Count and the Baronet von Buchanau in earnest conversation. A bottle of wine was open. Daniel said:</p>
				<p>&quot;A detective of the police wishes to see the Count.&quot; </p>
				<p>The Count frowned. &quot;Will they never leave me at rest?&quot; he asked in an angry tone. &quot;I have told them all I know.&quot; </p>
				<p>I entered and said, &quot;Excuse me, Count, but I am ordered to search the castle.&quot;</p>
				<p>The Count turned towards me inquiringly. I introduced myself again.</p>
				<p>&quot;A search of the castle!&quot; he replied. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;We also intend to search the park-where you had your conversation with the sailor.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;I hope you do not doubt the truth of my statements!&quot; said the Count vigorously, though I noticed that his voice shook a little.</p>
				<p>&quot;Not in the least,&quot; I replied with a bow. &quot;I am simply ordered to find a trace of a man who has suddenly disappeared. Our inquiries lead us to believe that he may have met with some accident.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;It seems to me that it is very probable that, having received money from me, he has gone to some seaport to spend it with other sailors,&quot; said the Count.</p>
				<p>&quot;There are too many grounds against that supposition,&quot; I replied. &quot;He has not been seen to leave on any train, and a man wearing sailor's clothes would have attracted attention. Moreover, we may safely assume that he would not leave without saying goodbye to Miss Vogel, to whom he was much attached.&quot;</p>
				<p>The Count stood up. &quot;Do you wish me to accompany you?&quot; he asked.</p>
				<p>&quot;If you will be so kind,&quot; I replied.</p>
				<p>The Baronet von Buchanau went with us, and in the garden we met two other gentlemen who had come to see the Count. These also came. The Count went quickly through the garden, towards the park, his gloomy face plainly indicating that he did so very unwillingly.</p>
				<p>&quot;Here,&quot; he said curtly, &quot;the sailor was sitting on this bench waiting for me. If I had had no pity on the man and had ordered my servants to throw him out, perhaps it would have been better.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;You went with him from here to the gate of the park?&quot; I asked, while I looked sharply around, paying particular attention to the immediate surroundings of the bench.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied. &quot;He told me his circumstances and said that he could not expect anything of his relations.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Which way did you walk?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Along the path we are on now. It leads straight to the gates.&quot;</p>
				<p>We had now arrived at the end of the park. A small gate led into the wood. It stood open.</p>
				<p>&quot;Here I gave him the money,&quot; said the Count. &quot;Two bills of a hundred thalers. He put them in a small leather purse, shook hands with me, and went away.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;He went away through the wood?&quot; I asked.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes. He could get back to the town by this road, and he seemed to prefer the wood.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;I am led to believe that he never left the wood. We shall have to search it,&quot; I said.</p>
				<p>&quot;I can hardly believe that he met with an accident,&quot; replied the Count. &quot;In my opinion it would be far better to try to trace the bills I gave him.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;You can rest assured that nothing will be left undone,&quot; I answered sharply. &quot;If I am not mistaken, there is a small lake in the wood.&quot;</p>
				<p>The Count agreed, adding, &quot;We can hardly suspect that the man drowned himself!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;No,&quot; said the Baron von Buchanau, laughing, &quot;a man with two hundred thalers in his pocket loves life too well!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Can the lake be drained?&quot; I inquired.</p>
				<p>&quot;My superintendent can answer that. I do not know anything about it,&quot; said the Count.</p>
				<p>The lake was soon reached. A footpath led to it from the road. Unnoticed by the others, I stayed behind on the path, and from there I went into the bushes. The others had now reached the lake, and I heard one of them say:</p>
				<p>&quot;This is strange! Look, here is an impression in the mould, as if a body had lain here.&quot;</p>
				<p>I could see the Count take off his hat and wipe his forehead. He looked dazed. At that moment I came forward. I had found traces and had followed them all along the ground.</p>
				<p>&quot;Have you made any discovery?&quot; asked the Baronet.</p>
				<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied. &quot;The sailor seems to have fallen down on the path. There are tracks showing that he was dragged to where we are standing. The body was probably thrown into the water from here.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;That is merely a supposition,&quot; said the Count, wiping his forehead again.</p>
				<p>&quot;That is true. It is only a supposition, but there are indications that confirm it. If you follow back from this point into the bushes, you will find broken twigs and in the grass the marks of a heavy body.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Have you found any bloodstains?&quot; asked the Baronet.</p>
				<p>&quot;No, and in any event, I think it better to search the lake,&quot; I replied. The others, with the sole exception of the Count, agreed with me.</p>
				<p>&quot;You are really going to search the lake?&quot; asked the Count. &quot;I will certainly not prevent it, but, believe me, you are troubling yourself in vain. The sailor was a strong man and would not have been overpowered easily. If you have not found traces of a struggle, the other signs mean nothing.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;It will be time for reasoning when we have exhausted the material clues,&quot; I answered coolly, almost rudely.</p>
				<p>&quot;The lake must be dragged. It may not be necessary to drain it. May I send word to your superintendent to let us have some men with rakes?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Certainly! Certainly!&quot; exclaimed the Count.</p>
				<p>I at once requested one of the officers, who had come up with us, to go in search of the men, and he soon returned with four laborers, provided with the necessary tools. A boat was drawn inshore, and we commenced our work. The men dragged the lake for some time, and then, all at once, one of them shouted:</p>
				<p>&quot;I have him! He is here!&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Go gently,&quot; I called. &quot;Draw slowly and steadily.&quot; And then, turning to one of my own men, I told him to hurry into the town and get the medical examiner. At this the Baronet offered the use of his carriage, which was standing before the castle, and in this the man went off.</p>
				<p>The body was drawn on shore. There was a large wound, evidently caused by a knife of some kind, near the heart. I now knew enough, and without being observed, and while the others were looking at the body, I looked at the pocketbook I had taken from the soggy coat. There were no bank notes there. I went back into the bushes and, searching carefully, I found traces of blood. Also, I found, buried in a bush, a stiletto, with the initials D.N. engraved on the hilt. It was clear that the story that the sailor had told Miss Vogel, and that she had told me, had been borne out. Diedrich Neumann, the pseudo Count, had committed the murder in order to rid himself of the only man, so he supposed, who knew of his original crime. I went up to Neumann and put my hand on his shoulder, saying:</p>
				<p>&quot;Diedrich Neumann, I arrest you in the name of the law, for double murder and for theft.&quot;</p>
				<p>Neumann grew very pale. His head dropped on his breast, and without a word he followed me to the castle, where I put him into a carriage and took him to the Chief of Police.</p>
				<p>Neumann's run of luck was ended.</p>
				<p>One cannot but wonder, at this point, why Thomas, who had displayed so much sagacity in ferreting out the crime and in following the trail, had done the mad thing of facing Neumann alone, instead of putting his information in the hands of the police and leaving them to act on it. Probably, he wanted the satisfaction of confronting the murderer with his knowledge and of seeing him collapse under it. He might have known, however, that if he drove Neumann into a corner the impostor's only hope would be in putting Thomas out of the way. Thomas got his triumph, but he paid for it with his life. The bloodhound had run his prey to earth. It now remained for others to make the final kill.</p>
				<p>After a short preliminary hearing, in which Neumann denied every charge, he was remanded to jail. He was not permitted to give bail, the judge remarking that, if the charges against him were true, the very money that he would use for bail would be that which he had stolen. There are not a few modern judges who might profit by the example.</p>
				<p>Neumann was put promptly on trial. As he entered the courtroom, there were two faces there, among the crowd, that were well calculated to cause him uneasiness. One was that of an old man by the name of Schulze, whom he had known as a boy. The other belonged to a young woman whom he had seen with Thomas at the station at Hamburg and again at Bamberg. What was she there for? Neumann resolved to brave it out.</p>
				<p>On being asked his real name, the prisoner replied, &quot;I am the only son and heir of the deceased Count Kuno von Hohenstaufen. My own name is Count Kurt von Hohenstaufen, and I am the rightful possessor of the estates which have fallen into my hands, after the death of my father.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;Can you prove your identity?&quot; asked the court.</p>
				<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Before I left for America, my father gave me the necessary papers, which would prove my identity in case my rights to the succession should be disputed.&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;You are accused,&quot; said the judge, who conducted the examination, after the Continental fashion, &quot;of having assumed the name of Count Kurt von Hohenstaufen in order to come into the possession of property not belonging to you. What do you answer to this charge?&quot;</p>
				<p>&quot;I plead not guilty to both charges. They are absurd!&quot; said Neumann haughtily.</p>
				<p>&quot;That is enough,&quot; answered the judge. &quot;Schulze, look at the accused! You knew Diedrich Neumann in his boyhood. Will you now state, on your oath, whether or not you recognize this man, who asserts that he is the Count von Hohenstaufen?&quot;</p>
				<p>The old man trembled as he got to his feet, and grew red and white by turns. He looked at Neumann steadily and then exclaimed, &quot;It must be!&quot; as he stretched out his wrinkled hand to take the oath. Now came one of those twists that hang a man or save him. Fate played the first of her two trumps.</p>
				<p>Schulze testified as follows:</p>
				<p>&quot;I worked as a gardener for Mr. Diedrich Neumann, the father of the man who is now standing before me, accused of murder and fraud. If I had met him in the street, without anybody telling me who he was, I would have recognized him at once. Still, my eyes may be deceived. One thing will show. I remember that one day, when he was ten years old, in jumping over a brook, he fell and broke his arm. The bone was well set, but a ring formed where the fracture had healed. He showed me this several times, for I took a great interest in knowing whether or not this ring would disappear. I do not know whether it has vanished by now, but if it has not, it will show that I have not been mistaken.&quot;</p>
				<p>As the old man went on, Neumann's pallor increased, and black shadows began to show under his sunken eyes. As the testimony concluded and the judge ordered a physician to come forward and make the examination, Neumann spoke. He must have known that his hour was upon him.</p>
				<p>&quot;It is not necessary. I acknowledge that I am Diedrich Neumann.&quot;</p>
				<p>A cry rose from the crowded courtroom. The Countess Unica had fainted. She had come into court believing in the validity of Neumann's claims, and to have her newly found brother change before her eyes into an impostor and murderer was more than she could stand.</p>
				<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said the judge. &quot;But if you are Diedrich Neumann, how did you come into the possession of the papers which were to prove the identity of the Count von Hohenstaufen? Also-where is the Count?&quot;</p>
				<p>Neumann made a last throw to save his neck.</p>
				<p>Calmly and with the greatest conviction, he replied, &quot;The Count died in America. I was with him in his last moments, and on his deathbed he asked me to take the papers, bury him under my name, and claim his property. He did not wish that his stepmother or her daughter should come into the possession of an estate which, according to his opinion, had been usurped.&quot;</p>
				<p>The story was very thin indeed, but, lacking more material evidence against Neumann, it might conceivably have been accepted. Now, however, the last card was played.</p>
				<p>Vogel, brother of Alice, stood up and asked permission of the court to speak. This being granted, he said, &quot;My sister, Alice Vogel, wishes to give evidence. She can prove that the man standing there mocks justice, that he is a liar and an impostor, and that he does not deserve the consideration of the court.&quot;</p>
				<p>Alice Vogel took the stand and told her story. She told of meeting Thomas on shipboard, and of the long conversation in which he told her all that he knew and all that he suspected, of their following Neumann to Bamberg, and of how Thomas went to the castle to unmask him, never to return.</p>
				<p>It was enough. From that moment, Neumann was convicted.</p>
				<p>Alice Vogel ended her testimony in tears. The court thanked her, and then, turning to Neumann, the judge said, &quot;Diedrich Neumann, you have heard this witness. You can plainly see that Providence destined that Thomas, whom you brought to such a fearful end, should have told his story to Miss Vogel. It is true that this is only hearsay testimony, but I cannot doubt but that it can be fully substantiated by tracing your movements in America. This will take time, and the only benefit you can derive from it is to prolong your imprisonment and to delay a fate which you must know you cannot escape. Therefore, I ask you, in your own behalf, as well as in that of justice, to make a full confession. Perhaps this will act in your favor with the jury.&quot;</p>
				<p>Neumann was deathly pale. He rose to his feet with an effort, and spoke only after several attempts.</p>
				<p>&quot;I am ready to confess. I see by the evidence of this young woman that my hope that the last witness against me was Thomas has vanished.&quot; He then told how, when Count Kurt was ill in Alton, just after Neumann had seen the Personal in the Herald, he had made up his mind to kill the Count by poison. He had withheld the medicines prescribed by the doctor, and had given other drugs-he refused to say what—that increased rather than retarded the malady.</p>
				<p>&quot;He died,&quot; continued Neumann, &quot;and I buried him under my name, while I adopted that of Count Kurt, which I could substantiate by the papers I had taken from the red portfolio. Desire for money, perhaps the hand of Providence, made me do the foolish thing of going to the firm in St. Louis in my own name. I arrived at Bamberg, no one disputing my rights. Then Thomas came and stood before me, as an evil genius, threatening all my prospects, everything for which I had already committed a crime, for which I had sold my soul. I killed him!&quot;</p>
				<p>Neumann broke down, covered his face with his hands, and wept. After a short interval, he went on:</p>
				<p>&quot;May God forgive me and the jury have pity on me. The demon of money took possession of me. It was stronger than my better nature. I succumbed to the prospect spread before me.&quot;</p>
				<p>Impervious to this plea, as well they might be, the jury promptly brought in a verdict of murder in the first degree. The judge imposed the death penalty. Curiously enough, however, for some reason that has never been explained or understood, the Emperor commuted the sentence to imprisonment for life.</p>
				<p>The double murder and the successful impersonation are sufficiently remarkable in themselves to make this crime noteworthy. But when, added to these, we have, first, the strange early suspicion against Neumann, at a time when he probably had no criminal intent; second, the eighteen years of secret watching on the part of Thomas, that human bloodhound; and third, Thomas's chance recital of his story to Alice Vogel, which finally brought Neumann to justice, the story becomes, so far as I know, unique in the history of crime. Fate was powerless to save Kurt von Hohenstaufen, but she started his avenger on the blood trail eighteen years before the crime was committed!</p>

				<head type="chapter">EXEUNT MURDERERS</head>
				<p>THERE is an old story of a Harvard freshman who translated &quot;Apologia Pro Vita Sua&quot; as &quot;An Apology for Living in a Sewer.&quot; On being admonished for the freeness of his version, the young gentleman explained that he had thought it only natural, because anyone living in a sewer would be sure to apologize. I do not insist upon the aptness of the tale in the present instance. I only say that in sitting down to write a few words of explanation for this collection of stories of murder the anecdote comes to my mind.</p>
				<p>An apology, in the common sense, for a book dealing exclusively with murder is quite unnecessary. It is not my first offense, nor, I hope, will it be my last. If I sought popularized the story of Cain to him who performed a like service for Lizzie Borden. The truth is that there have always been a considerable number of people who have enjoyed stories of murder. May their numbers increase!</p>
				<p>Of these there have always been some who preferred true stories. I am of those.</p>
				<p>My only purpose here is to answer the inevitable ques-tion—upon what thread are these stories strung? Do these eight murders deal with a special period of history, or are they designed to shame the locality of their enactment? My answer is that there is no such thread at all. By chance, and purely by chance, they are all murders of the Nineteenth Century, ranging in date from 1826 to 1877. As for locality, they are no less diverse, for one takes place upon the high seas, four in fairly small towns and three in cities. True, they are all American, and that is deliberate, for Americans have a curious partiality to murders of their own committing; and they all are situated east of the Mississippi, but this also is chance. There has been no intention to slight the West.</p>
				<p>But if there is no visible thread connecting each of these murders with the other, there is, nevertheless, a very definite reason for the selection of every one of them. That reason is that each one of these eight murders is possessed of some specific quality, some distinct characteristic that sets it apart from its fellows. That is to say, however well or badly I may have told their stories, you will not find a single undistinguished murder in this book. Not all causes célèbres are worth perpetuation. Perhaps, even, comparatively few of them are worthy the attention of the connoisseur of crime. The famous Thaw case, for example, taken as a murder, was a very dull affair. These eight, however, are-different. (And this is not self-praise, for it was not I who made them so.)</p>
				<p>&quot;The Ship That Never Returned&quot; not only has that tang of salt sea air so pleasant to most landsmen, but it also poses a rather interesting minor mystery, vide the curious conduct of the Cunningham Brothers of Boston, shipowners. But these are its smallest claims to distinction. The amazing coincidence (rejected of fiction, but beloved of fact; for art must be logical while life seldom takes the trouble) by which two mutineers in a longboat, with a thousand miles of coast line to choose from, must needs put ashore at the one tiny spot where stands the house of the sister of the man they have just killed, is surely too remarkable to dwell upon.</p>
				<p>&quot;The Clue of the Dying Ducks,&quot; quite aside from its inherent color and dramatic values, certainly deserves its place as one of the most grotesque instances of middle-aged infatuation and successful imposture on record. I think that Dickens, for all his detestation of the American scene, would have liked that story.</p>
				<p>A far broader canvas and tragedy in a higher key marks &quot;The Veiled Murderess&quot; A modern Euripides might have fashioned this plot, for it is quite definitely in the Greek tradition. It must have parallels, but I do not know them. Even the prison records of 1855 have been destroyed by fire, so that Henrietta vanishes into a realm more mysterious than death because it is the more unusual.</p>
				<p>In &quot;Seven Who Were Silent&quot; we have not only an especially fine example of the ancient plot of the village belle and the village ne'er-do-well, but above all else we have mystery: the mystery of night and of a secret poison</p>
				<p>-how administered?—these, and the strange, frozen silence of the seven. The lonely countryside can be very secret and very terrible.</p>
				<p>Several years ago, in another book, I first wrote the history of General Daniel Sickles, here given under the title of &quot;The Murder That Led to Fame&quot;; but in that attempt I was so misguided as to tell the story from the standpoint of the trial, rather than by reconstructing the murder as it actually occurred. This is my correction. A man so conspicuously brave on the field of battle and so conspicuously cowardly in his private emotional life is worthy of a niche —whether in the hall of fame or that of infamy, I confess, I am not sure.</p>
				<p>A domestic triangle consisting of Paris, Helen, and Menelaus ripped asunder the ancient world, if we are to believe the poets, for the economists might have another. word to say upon the question. Even so did the tragedy of that pathetic figure, Abby McFarland Richardson, set the far smaller world of New York aflame at the time of its happening. To me, this case presents an immensely interesting cross section of Mid-Victorian American life. Taken in all its implications, it is a part of the history of America; not simply the story of a crime. In &quot;Death Draws a Triangle,&quot; I have tried to give the picture.</p>
				<p>New England, for some reason that is obscure to me, and I refuse to theorize about it, has always been notable, less for the quantity than for the quality of its murders. &quot;The Absent Witness&quot; is no exception. Dreams have quite often played a strange part in murders; indeed, I hope one day to make a collection of such cases; but I know of no example more direct or more dramatic than that contained in Mrs. Burton's letter. The case is remarkable in other ways, as an outstanding instance of circumstantial evidence and for the lapse of time between the murder and discovery of the body, but these points will, perhaps, interest the jurist rather than the layman, and it is for the layman that the story is given. As a New Yorker, I can only ask New England's forgiveness for my clumsy effort to interpret its atmosphere and background. If I have erred, it is in all affection.</p>
				<p>As for &quot;The Bloodhound of Fate,&quot; that is sheer melo-drama, and very good melodrama too. Frankly, it has been impossible to check the facts of this story thoroughly as I wished. With the murder taking place in one country and the trial in another; and with the whole happening more than a half century ago, really satisfactory verification has been beyond my reach. However, so far as I can find out, I believe the facts to be substantially as I have given them. In any event, it is an astounding tale, and for my own part, I give it credence.</p>
				<p>This, then, is the thread, or, better, these are the threads, upon which these eight narratives of murder are strung.</p>
				<p>The public—very wisely, I believe—is rapidly acquiring an ever more cultivated taste in murder. It was only a little more than one hundred years ago that De Quincey in his essay, &quot;On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts,&quot; chose for his prime example a vulgar slaughter which was, in reality, notable for little except for the amount of blood spilled. We have advanced during the last century, and rightly so. It is less the actual crime, the shot, the glass, the blow, that concerns the critical reader today than it is the course of mental and emotional development on the part of both murderer and murderee that culminated in the act. With this point of view I am wholly in sympathy, and I have endeavored, in a small way, to give position to it in these eight accounts.</p>
				<p>In nearly all old volumes of trials and collections of crimes the high moral value to be derived from a perusal of the work has been strongly emphasized, and so, lest I be accused of a dereliction of duty, I end by quoting in full the caption to the frontispiece of an old Newgate Calendar. The picture shows a mother, dressed in the costume of the period, about 1785, giving with one hand a copy of this elevating work to her young son, while with the other hand she points through the near-by window to a gibbet, which can be seen clearly outside. Below the picture is this verse: The anxious Mother with a parents Care, Presents our Labours to her future Heir. &quot;The Wise, the Brave, the Temperate, and the Just, Who love their Neighbor, and in God who trust, Safe through the Dangerous paths of Life may Steer, Nor dread those Evils we exhibit Here.&quot; May this book be no less effective!</p>
				<p>THE END</p>
