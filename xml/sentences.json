    "Not once was he known to take a purse with his own hand, the summit of his achievement being to hold the horses' heads while his accomplice spoke with the passengers.",
    "A poltroon before his arrest, in Court he whimpered and whinnied for mercy; he was carried to the cart pallid and trembling, and not even his preposterous finery availed to hearten him at the gallows.",
    "Taxed with his timidity, he attempted to excuse himself on the inadmissible plea of moral rectitude.",
    "'I have as much personal courage in an honourable cause,' he exclaimed in a passage of false dignity, 'as any man in Britain; but as I knew I was committing acts of injustice, so I went to them half loth and half consenting; and in that sense I own I am a coward indeed.'",
    "The disingenuousness of this proclamation is as remarkable as its hypocrisy.",
    "Well might he brag of his courage in an honourable cause, when he knew that he could never be put to the test.",
    "But what palliation shall you find for a rogue with so little pride in his art, that he exercised it 'half loth, half consenting'?",
    "It is not in this recreant spirit that masterpieces are achieved, and Maclaine had better have stayed in the far Highland parish, which bred him, than have attempted to cut a figure in the larger world of London.",
    "His famous encounter with Walpole should have covered him with disgrace, for it was ignoble at every point; and the art was so little understood, that it merely added a leaf to his crown of glory.",
    "Now, though Walpole was far too well-bred to oppose the demand of an armed stranger, Maclaine, in defiance of his craft, discharged his pistol at an innocent head.",
    "True, he wrote a letter of apology, and insisted that, had the one pistol-shot proved fatal, he had another in reserve for himself.",
    "But not even Walpole would have believed him, had not an amiable faith given him an opportunity for the answering quip: 'Can I do less than say I will be hanged if he is?'",
    "As Maclaine was a coward and no thief, so also he was a snob and no gentleman.",
    "His boasted elegance was not more respectable than his art.",
    "Fine clothes are the embellishment of a true adventurer; they hang ill on the sloping shoulders of a poltroon.",
    "And Maclaine, with all the ostensible weaknesses of his kind, would claim regard for the strength that he knew not.",
    "He occupied a costly apartment in St. James's Street; his morning dress was a crimson damask banjam, a silk shag waistcoat, trimmed with lace, black velvet breeches, white silk stockings, and yellow morocco slippers; but since his magnificence added no jot to his courage, it was rather mean than admirable.",
    "Indeed, his whole career was marred by the provincialism of his native manse.",
    "And he was the adored of an intelligent age; he basked a few brief weeks in the noonday sun of fashion.",
    "If distinction was not the heritage of the Eighteenth Century, its glory is that now and again a giant raised his head above the stature of a prevailing rectitude.",
    "The art of verse was lost in rhetoric; the noble prose, invented by the Elizabethans, and refined under the Stuarts, was whittled away to common sense by the admirers of Addison and Steele.",
    "Swift and Johnson, Gibbon and Fielding, were apparitions of strength in an amiable, ineffective age.",
    "They emerged sudden from the impeccable greyness, to which they afforded an heroic contrast.",
    "So, while the highway drifted-drifted to a vulgar incompetence, the craft was illumined by many a flash of unexpected genius.",
    "The brilliant achievements of Jonathan Wild and of Jack Sheppard might have relieved the gloom of the darkest era, and their separate masterpieces make some atonement for the environing cowardice and stupidity.",
    "Above all, the Eighteenth Century was Newgate's golden age; now for the first time and the last were the rules and customs of the Jug perfectly understood.",
    "If Jonathan the Great was unrivalled in the art of clapping his enemies into prison, if Jack the Slip-string was supreme in the rarer art of getting himself out, even the meanest criminal of his time knew what was expected of him, so long as he wandered within the walled yard, or listened to the ministrations of the snuff-besmirched Ordinary.",
    "He might show a lamentable lack of cleverness in carrying off his booty; he might prove a too easy victim to the wiles of the thief-catcher; but he never fell short of courage, when asked to sustain the consequences of his crime.",
    "Newgate, compared by one eminent author to a university, by another to a ship, was a republic, whose liberty extended only so far as its iron door.",
    "While there was no liberty without, there was licence within; and if the culprit, who paid for the smallest indiscretion with his neck, understood the etiquette of the place, he spent his last weeks in an orgie of rollicking lawlessness.",
    "He drank, he ate, he diced; he received his friends, or chaffed the Ordinary; he attempted, through the well-paid cunning of the Clerk, to bribe the jury; and when every artifice had failed he went to Tyburn like a man.",
    "If he knew not how to live, at least he would show a resentful world how to die.",
    "'In no country,' wrote Sir T. Smith, a distinguished lawyer of the time, 'do malefactors go to execution more intrepidly than in England'; and assuredly, buoyed up by custom and the approval of their fellows, Wild's victims made a brave show at the gallows.",
    "Nor was their bravery the result of a common callousness.",
    "They understood at once the humour and the delicacy of the situation.",
    "Though hitherto they had chaffed the Ordinary, they now listened to his exhortation with at least a semblance of respect; and though their last night upon earth might have been devoted to a joyous company, they did not withhold their ear from the Bellman's Chant.",
    "As twelve o'clock approached-their last midnight upon earth-they would interrupt the most spirited discourse, they would check the tour of the mellowest bottle to listen to the solemn doggerel.",
    "'All you that in the condemn'd hole do lie,' groaned the Bellman of St. Sepulchre's in his duskiest voice, and they who held revel in the condemned hole prayed silence of their friends for the familiar cadences:                       All you that in the condemn'd hole do lie,  Prepare you, for to-morrow you shall die,  Watch all and pray, the hour is drawing near,  That you before th' Almighty must appear.",
    "Examine well yourselves, in time repent  That you may not t' eternal flames be sent;  And when St. Pulchre's bell to-morrow tolls,  The Lord above have mercy on your souls.",
    "Past twelve o'clock!",
    "Even if this warning voice struck a momentary terror into their offending souls, they were up betimes in the morning, eager to pay their final debt.",
    "Their journey from Newgate to Tyburn was a triumph, and their vanity was unabashed at the droning menaces of the Ordinary.",
    "At one point a chorus of maidens cast wreaths upon their way, or pinned nosegays in their coats, that they might not face the executioner unadorned.",
    "At the Crown Tavern they quaffed their last glass of ale, and told the landlord with many a leer and smirk that they would pay him on their way back.",
    "Though gravity was asked, it was not always given; but in the Eighteenth Century courage was seldom wanting.",
    "To the common citizen a violent death was (and is) the worst of horrors; to the ancient highwayman it was the odd trick lost in the game of life.",
    "And the highwayman endured the rope, as the practised gambler loses his estate, without blenching.",
    "One there was, who felt his leg tremble in his own despite: wherefore he stamped it upon the ground so violently, that in other circumstances he would have roared with pain, and he left the world without a tremor.",
    "In this spirit Cranmer burnt his recreant right hand, and in either case the glamour of a unique occasion was a stimulus to courage.",
    "But not even this brilliant treatment of accessories availed to save the highway from disrepute; indeed, it had become the profitless pursuit of braggarts and loafers, long before the abolition of the stage-coach destroyed its opportunity.",
    "In the meantime, however, the pickpocket was master of his trade.",
    "His strategy was perfect, his sleight of hand as delicate as long, lithe fingers and nimble brains could make it.",
    "He had discarded for ever those clumsy instruments whose use had barred the progress of the Primitives.",
    "The breast-pocket behind the tightest buttoned coat presented no difficulty to his love of research, and he would penetrate the stoutest frieze or the lightest satin, as easily as Jack Sheppard made a hole through Newgate.",
    "His trick of robbery was so simple and yet so successful, that ever since it has remained a tradition.",
    "The collision, the victim's murmured apology, the hasty scuffle, the booty handed to the aide-de-camp, who is out of sight before the hue and cry can be raised-such was the policy advocated two hundred years ago; such is the policy pursued to day by the few artists that remain.",
    "Throughout the eighteenth century the art of cly-faking held its own, though its reputation paled in the glamour of the highway.",
    "It culminated in George Barrington, whose vivid genius persuaded him to work alone and to carry off his own booty; it still flourished (in a silver age) when the incomparable Haggart performed his prodigies of skill; even in our prosaic time some flashes of the ancient glory have been seen.",
    "Now and again circumstances have driven it into eclipse.",
    "When the facile sentiment of the Early Victorian Era poised the tear of sympathy upon every trembling eyelid, the most obdurate was forced to provide himself with a silk handkerchief of equal size and value.",
    "Now, a wipe is the easiest booty in the world, and the Artful Dodger might grow rich without the exercise of the smallest skill.",
    "But wipes dwindled, with dwindling sensibility; and once more the pickpocket was forced upon cleverness or extinction.",
    "At the same time the more truculent trade of housebreaking was winning a lesser triumph of its own.",
    "Never, save in the hands of one or two distinguished practitioners, has this clumsy, brutal pursuit taken on the refinement of an art.",
    "Essentially modern, it has generally been pursued in the meanest spirit of gain.",
    "Deacon Brodie clung to it as to a diversion, but he was an amateur, without a clear understanding of his craft's possibilities.",
    "The sole monarch of housebreakers was Charles Peace.",
    "At a single stride he surpassed his predecessors; nor has the greatest of his imitators been worthy to hand on the candle which he left at the gallows.",
    "For the rest, there is small distinction in breaking windows, wielding crowbars, and battering the brains of defenceless old gentlemen.",
    "And it is to such miserable tricks as this that he who two centuries since rode abroad in all the glory of the High-toby-splice descends in these days of avarice and stupidity.",
    "The legislators who decreed that henceforth the rope should be reserved for the ultimate crime of murder were inspired with a proper sense of humour and proportion.",
    "It would be ignoble to dignify that ugly enterprise of to-day, the cracking of suburban cribs, with the same punishment which was meted out to Claude Duval and the immortal Switcher.",
    "Better for the churl the disgrace of Portland than the chance of heroism and respect given at the Tree!",
    "And where are the heroes whose art was as glorious as their intrepidity?",
    "One and all they have climbed the ascent of Tyburn.",
    "One and all, they have leaped resplendent from the cart.",
    "The world, which was the joyous playground of highwaymen and pickpockets, is now the Arcadia of swindlers.",
    "The man who once went forth to meet his equal on the road, now plunders the defenceless widow or the foolish clergyman from the security of an office.",
    "He has changed Black Bess for a brougham, his pistol for a cigar; a sleek chimney-pot sits upon the head, which once carried a jaunty hat, three-cornered; spats have replaced the tops of ancient times; and a heavy fur coat advertises at once the wealth and inaction of the modern brigand.",
    "No longer does he roam the heaths of Hounslow or Bagshot; no longer does he track the grazier to a country fair.",
    "Fearful of an encounter, he chooses for the fields of his enterprise the byways of the City, and the advertisement columns of the smugly Christian Press.",
    "He steals without risking his skin or losing his respectability.",
    "The suburb, wherein he brings up a blameless, flat-footed family, regards him as its most renowned benefactor.",
    "He is generally a pillar (or a buttress) of the Church, and oftentimes a mayor; with his ill-gotten wealth he promotes charities, and endows schools; his portrait is painted by a second-rate Academician, and hangs, until disaster overtakes him, in the town-hall of his adopted borough.",
    "How much worse is he than the High-toby-cracks of old!",
    "They were as brave as lions; he is a very louse for timidity.",
    "His conduct is meaner than the conduct of the most ruffianly burglar that ever worked a centre-bit.",
    "Of art he has not the remotest inkling: though his greed is bounded by the Bank of England, he understands not the elegancies of life; he cares not how he plumps his purse, so long as it be full; and if he were capable of conceiving a grand effect, he would willingly surrender it for a pocketed half-crown.",
    "This side the Channel, in brief, romance and the picturesque are dead; and in France, the last refuge of crime, there are already signs of decay.",
    "The Abbe Bruneau caught a whiff of style and invention from the past.",
    "That other Abbe-Rosslot was his name-shone forth a pure creator: he owed his prowess to the example of none.",
    "But in Paris crime is too often passionel, and a crime passionel is a crime with a purpose, which, like the novel with a purpose, is conceived by a dullard, and carried out for the gratification of the middle-class.",
    "To whitewash the scoundrel is to put upon him the heaviest dishonour: a dishonour comparable only to the monstrously illogical treatment of the condemned.",
    "When once a hero has forfeited his right to comfort and freedom, when he is deemed no longer fit to live upon earth, the Prison Chaplain, encouraging him to a final act of hypocrisy, gives him a free pass (so to say) into another and more exclusive world.",
    "So, too, the moralist would test the thief by his own narrow standard, forgetting that all professions are not restrained by the same code.",
    "The road has its ordinances as well as the lecture-room; and if the thief is commonly a bad moralist, it is certain that no moralist was ever a great thief.",
    "Why then detract from a man's legitimate glory?",
    "Is it not wiser to respect 'that deep intuition of oneness,' which Coleridge says is 'at the bottom of our faults as well as our virtues?'",
    "To recognise that a fault in an honest man is a virtue in a scoundrel?",
    "After all, he is eminent who, in obedience to his talent, does prodigies of valour unrivalled by his fellows.",
    "And none has so many opportunities of various eminence as the scoundrel.",
    "The qualities which may profitably be applied to a cross life are uncommon and innumerable.",
    "It is not given to all men to be light-brained, light-limbed, light-fingered.",
    "A courage which shall face an enemy under the starlight, or beneath the shadow of a wall, which shall track its prey to a well-defended lair, is far rarer than a law-abiding cowardice.",
    "The recklessness that risks all for a present advantage is called genius, if a victorious general urge it to success; nor can you deny to the intrepid Highwayman, whose sudden resolution triumphs at an instant of peril, the possession of an admirable gift.",
    "But all heroes have not proved themselves excellent at all points.",
    "This one has been distinguished for the courtly manner of his attack, that other for a prescience which discovers booty behind a coach-door or within the pocket of a buttoned coat.",
    "If Cartouche was a master of strategy, Barrington was unmatched in another branch; and each may claim the credit due to a peculiar eminence.",
    "It is only thus that you may measure conflicting talents: as it were unfair to judge a poet by a brief experiment in prose, so it would be monstrous to cheapen the accomplishments of a pickpocket, because he bungled at the concealment of his gains.",
    "A stern test of artistry is the gallows.",
    "Perfect behaviour at an enforced and public scrutiny may properly be esteemed an effect of talent-an effect which has not too often been rehearsed.",
    "There is no reason why the Scoundrel, fairly beaten at the last point in the game, should not go to his death without swagger and without remorse.",
    "At least he might comfort himself with such phrases as 'a dance without the music,' and he has not often been lacking in courage.",
    "What he has missed is dignity: his pitfalls have been unctuosity, on the one side, bravado on the other.",
    "It was the Prison Ordinary, who first misled him into the assumption of a piety which neither preacher nor disciple understood.",
    "It was the Prison Ordinary, who persuaded him to sign his name to a lying confession of guilt, drawn up in accordance with a foolish and inexorable tradition, and to deliver such a last dying speech as would not disappoint the mob.",
    "The set phrases, the vain prayer offered for other sinners, the hypocritical profession of a superior righteousness, were neither noble nor sincere.",
    "When Tom Jones (for instance) was hanged, in 1702, after a prosperous career on Hounslow Heath, his biographer declared that he behaved with more than usual 'modesty and decency,' because he 'delivered a pretty deal of good advice to the young men present, exhorting them to be industrious in their several callings.'",
    "Whereas his biographer should have discovered that it is not thus that your true hero bids farewell to frolic and adventure.",
    "As little in accordance with good taste was the last appearance of the infamous Jocelin Harwood, who was swung from the cart in 1692 for murder and robbery.",
    "He arrived at Tyburn insolently drunk.",
    "He blustered and ranted, until the spectators hissed their disapproval, and he died vehemently shouting that he would act the same murder again in the same case.",
    "Unworthy, also, was the last dying repartee of Samuel Shotland, a notorious bully of the Eighteenth Century.",
    "Taking off his shoes, he hurled them into the crowd, with a smirk of delight.",
    "'My father and mother often told me,' he cried, 'that I should die with my shoes on; but you may all see that I have made them both liars.'",
    "A great man dies not with so mean a jest, and Tyburn was untouched to mirth by Shotland's facile humour.",
    "On the other hand, there are those who have given a splendid example of a brave and dignified death.",
    "Brodie was a sorry bungler when at work, but a perfect artist at the gallows.",
    "The glory of his last achievement will never fade.",
    "The muttered prayer, unblemished by hypocrisy, the jest thrown at George Smith-a metaphor from the gaming-table-the silent adjustment of the cord which was to strangle him, these last offices were performed with an unparalleled quietude and restraint.",
    "Though he had pattered the flash to all his wretched accomplices, there was no trace of the last dying speech in his final utterances, and he set an example of a simple greatness, worthy to be followed even to the end of time.",
    "Such is the type, but others also have given proof of a serene temper.",
    "Tom Austin's masterpiece was in another kind, but it was none the less a masterpiece.",
    "At the very moment that the halter was being put about his neck, he was asked by the Chaplain what he had to say before he died.",
    "'Only,' says he, 'there's a woman yonder with some curds and whey, and I wish I could have a pennyworth of them before I am hanged, because I don't know when I shall see any again.'",
    "There is a brave irrelevance in this very human desire, which is beyond praise.",
    "Valiant also was the conduct of Roderick Audrey, who after a brief but brilliant career paid his last debt to the law in 1714.",
    "He was but sixteen, and, says his biographer, 'he went very decent to the gallows, being in a white waistcoat, clean napkin, white gloves, and an orange in one hand.'",
    "So well did he play his part, that one wonders Jack Ketch did not shrink from the performance of his.",
    "But throughout his short life, Roderick Audrey-the very name is an echo of romance!-displayed a contempt for whatever was common or ugly.",
    "Not only was his appearance at Tyburn a lesson in elegance, but he thieved, as none ever thieved before or since, with no other accomplice than a singing-bird.",
    "Thus he would play outside a house, wherein he espied a sideboard of plate, and at last, bidding his playmate flutter through an open window into the parlour, he would follow upon the excuse of recovery, and, once admitted, would carry off as much silver as he could conceal.",
    "None other ever attempted so graceful an artifice, and yet Audrey's journey to Tyburn is even more memorable than the story of his gay accomplice.",
    "But it is not only the truly great who have won for themselves an enduring reputation.",
    "There are men, not a few, esteemed, like the popular novelist, not for their art but for some foolish gift, some facile trick of notoriety, whose actions have tickled the fancy, not the understanding of the world.",
    "The coward and the impostor have been set upon a pedestal of glory either by accident or by the whim of posterity.",
    "For more than a century Dick Turpin has appeared not so much the greatest of highwaymen, as the Highwaymen Incarnate.",
    "His prowess has been extolled in novels and upon the stage; his ride to York is still bepraised for a feat of miraculous courage and endurance; the death of Black Bess has drawn floods of tears down the most callous cheeks.",
    "And the truth is that Turpin was never a gentleman of the road at all!",
    "Black Bess is as pure an invention as the famous ride to York.",
    "The ruffian, who is said to have ridden the phantom mare from one end of England to the other, was a common butcher, who burned an old woman to death at Epping, and was very properly hanged at York for the stealing of a horse which he dared not bestride.",
    "Not one incident in his career gives colour to the splendid myth which has been woven round his memory.",
    "Once he was in London, and he died at York.",
    "So much is true; but there is naught to prove that his progress from the one town to the other did not occupy a year.",
    "Nor is there any reason why the halo should have been set upon his head rather than upon another's.",
    "Strangest truth of all, none knows at what moment Dick Turpin first shone into glory.",
    "At any rate, there is a gap in the tradition, and the chap-books of the time may not be credited with this vulgar error.",
    "Perhaps it was the popular drama of Skelt which put the ruffian upon the black mare's back; but whatever the date of the invention, Turpin was a popular hero long before Ainsworth sent him rattling across England.",
    "And in order to equip this butcher with a false reputation, a valiant officer and gentleman was stripped of the credit due to a magnificent achievement.",
    "For though Turpin tramped to York at a journeyman's leisure, Nicks rode thither at a stretch-Nicks the intrepid and gallant, whom Charles II., in admiration of his feat, was wont to call Swiftnicks.",
    "This valiant collector, whom posterity has robbed for Turpin's embellishment, lived at the highest moment of his art.",
    "He knew by rote the lessons taught by Hind and Duval; he was a fearless rider and a courteous thief.",
    "Now, one morning at five of the clock, he robbed a gentleman near Barnet of \ufffd560, and riding straight for York, he appeared on the Bowling Green at six in the evening.",
    "Being presently recognised by his victim, he was apprehended, and at the trial which followed he pleaded a triumphant alibi.",
    "But vanity was too strong for discretion, and no sooner was Swiftnicks out of danger, than he boasted, as well he might, of his splendid courage.",
    "Forthwith he appeared a popular hero, obtained a commission in Lord Moncastle's regiment, and married a fortune.",
    "And then came Turpin to filch his glory!",
    "Nor need Turpin have stooped to a vicarious notoriety, for he possessed a certain rough, half conscious humour, which was not despicable.",
    "He purchased a new fustian coat and a pair of pumps, in which to be hanged, and he hired five poor men at ten shillings the day, that his death might not go unmourned.",
    "Above all, he was distinguished in prison.",
    "A crowd thronged his cell to identify him, and one there was who offered to bet the keeper half a guinea that the prisoner was not Turpin; whereupon Turpin whispered the keeper, 'Lay him the wager, you fool, and I will go you halves.'",
    "Surely this impudent indifference might have kept green the memory of the man who never rode to York!",
    "If the Scoundrel may claim distinction on many grounds, his character is singularly uniform.",
    "To the anthropologist he might well appear the survival of a savage race, and savage also are his manifold superstitions.",
    "He is a creature of times and seasons.",
    "He chooses the occasion of his deeds with as scrupulous a care as he examines his formidable crowbars and jemmies.",
    "At certain hours he would refrain from action, though every circumstance favoured his success: he would rather obey the restraining voice of a wise, unreasoning wizardry, than fill his pockets with the gold for which his human soul is ever hungry.",
    "There is no law of man he dares not break but he shrinks in horror from the infringement of the unwritten rules of savagery.",
    "Though he might cut a throat in self-defence, he would never walk under a ladder; and if the 13th fell on a Friday, he would starve that day rather than obtain a loaf by the method he best understands.",
    "He consults the omens with as patient a divination as the augurs of old; and so long as he carries an amulet in his pocket, though it be but a pebble or a polished nut, he is filled with an irresistible courage.",
    "For him the worst terror of all is the evil eye, and he would rather be hanged by an unsuspected judge than receive an easy stretch from one whose glance he dared not face.",
    "And while the anthropologist claims him for a savage, whose civilisation has been arrested at brotherhood with the Solomon Islanders, the politician might pronounce him a true communist, in that he has preserved a wholesome contempt of property and civic life.",
    "The pedant, again, would feel his bumps, prescribe a gentle course of bromide, and hope to cure all the sins of the world by a municipal Turkish bath.",
    "The wise man, respecting his superstitions, is content to take him as he finds him, and to deduce his character from his very candid history, which is unaffected by pedant or politician.",
    "Before all things, he is sanguine; he believes that Chance, the great god of his endeavour, fights upon his side.",
    "Whatever is lacking to-day, to-morrow's enterprise will fulfil, and if only the omens be favourable, he fears neither detection nor the gallows.",
    "His courage proceeds from this sanguine temperament, strengthened by shame and tradition rather than from a self-controlled magnanimity; he hopes until despair is inevitable, and then walks firmly to the gallows, that no comrade may suspect the white feather.",
    "His ambition, too, is the ambition of the savage or of the child; he despises such immaterial advantages as power and influence, being perfectly content if he have a smart coat on his back and a bottle of wine at his elbow.",
    "He would rather pick a lock than batter a constitution, and the world would be well lost, if he and his doxy might survey the ruin in comfort.",
    "But if his ambition be modest, his love of notoriety is boundless.",
    "He must be famous, his name must be in the mouths of men, he must be immortal (for a week) in a rough woodcut.",
    "And then, what matters it how soon the end?",
    "His braveries have been hawked in the street; his prowess has sold a Special Edition; he is the first of his race, until a luckier rival eclipses him.",
    "Thus, also, his dandyism is inevitable: it is not enough for him to cover his nakedness-he must dress; and though his taste is sometimes unbridled, it is never insignificant.",
    "Indeed, his biographers have recorded the expression of his fancy in coats and small-clothes as patiently and enthusiastically as they have applauded his courage.",
    "And truly the love of magnificence, which he shares with all artists, is sincere and characteristic.",
    "When an accomplice of Jonathan Wild's robbed Lady M--n at Windsor, his equipage cost him forty pounds; and Nan Hereford was arrested for shoplifting at the very moment that four footmen awaited her return with an elegant sedan-chair.",
    "His vanity makes him but a prudish lover, who desires to woo less than to be wooed; and at all times and through all moods he remains the primeval sentimentalist.",
    "He will detach his life entirely from the catchwords which pretend to govern his actions; he will sit and croon the most heartrending ditties in celebration of home-life and a mother's love, and then set forth incontinently upon a well-planned errand of plunder.",
    "For all his artistry, he lacks balance as flagrantly as a popular politician or an advanced journalist.",
    "Therefore it is the more remarkable that in one point he displays a certain caution: he boggles at a superfluous murder.",
    "For all his contempt of property, he still preserves a respect for life, and the least suspicion of unnecessary brutality sets not only the law but his own fellows against him.",
    "Like all men whose god is Opportunity, he is a reckless gambler; and, like all gamblers, he is monstrously extravagant.",
    "In brief, he is a tangle of picturesque qualities, which, until our own generation, was incapable of nothing save dulness.",
    "The Bible and the Newgate Calendar-these twain were George Borrow's favourite reading, and all save the psychologist and the pedant will applaud the preference.",
    "For the annals of the 'family' are distinguished by an epic severity, a fearless directness of speech, which you will hardly match outside the Iliad or the Chronicles of the Kings.",
    "But the Newgate Calendar did not spring ready-made into being: it is the result of a curious and gradual development.",
    "The chap-books came first, with their bold type, their coarse paper, and their clumsy, characteristic woodcuts-the chap-books, which none can contemplate without an enchanted sentiment.",
    "Here at last you come upon a literature, which has been read to pieces.",
    "The very rarity of the slim, rough volumes, proves that they have been handed from one greedy reader to another, until the great libraries alone are rich enough to harbour them.",
    "They do not boast the careful elegance of a famous press: many of them came from the printing-office of a country town: yet the least has a simplicity and concision, which are unknown in this age of popular fiction.",
    "Even their lack of invention is admirable: as the same woodcut might be used to represent Guy, Earl of Warwick, or the last highwayman who suffered at Tyburn, so the same enterprise is ascribed with a delightful ingenuousness to all the heroes who rode abroad under the stars to fill their pockets.",
    "The Life and Death of Gamaliel Ratsey delighted England in 1605, and was the example of after ages.",
    "The anecdote of the road was already crystallised, and henceforth the robber was unable to act contrary to the will of the chap-book.",
    "Thus there grew up a folk-lore of thievery: the very insistence upon the same motive suggests the fairytale, and, as in the legends of every country, there is an identical element which the anthropologists call 'human'; so in the annals of adventure there is a set of invariable incidents, which are the essence of thievery.",
    "The industrious hacks, to whom we owe the entertainment of the chap-books, being seedy parsons or lawyers' clerks, were conscious of their literary deficiencies: they preferred to obey tradition rather than to invent ineptitudes.",
    "So you may trace the same jest, the same intrigue through the unnumbered lives of three centuries.",
    "And if, being a philosopher, you neglect the obvious plagiarism, you may induce from these similarities a cunning theory concerning the uniformity of the human brain.",
    "But the easier explanation is, as always, the more satisfactory; and there is little doubt that in versatility the thief surpassed his historian.",
    "Had the chap-books still been scattered in disregarded corners, they would have been unknown or misunderstood.",
    "Happily, a man of genius came in the nick to convert them into as vivid and sparkling a piece of literature as the time could show.",
    "This was Captain Alexander Smith, whose Lives of the Highwaymen, published in 1719, was properly described by its author as 'the first impartial piece of this nature which ever appeared in English.'",
    "Now, Captain Smith inherited from a nameless father no other patrimony than a fierce loyalty to the Stuarts, and the sanguine temperament which views in horror a well-ordered life.",
    "Though a mere foundling, he managed to acquire the rudiments, and he was not wholly unlettered when at eighteen he took to the road.",
    "His courage, fortified by an intimate knowledge of the great tradition, was rewarded by an immediate success, and he rapidly became the master of so much leisure as enabled him to pursue his studies with pleasure and distinction.",
    "When his companions damned him for a milksop, he was loftily contemptuous, conscious that it was not in intelligence alone that he was their superior.",
    "While the Stuarts were the gods of his idolatry, while the Regicides were the fiends of his frank abhorrence, it was from the Elizabethans that he caught the splendid vigour of his style; and he owed not only his historical sense, but his living English to the example of Philemon Holland.",
    "Moreover, it is to his constant glory that, living at a time that preferred as well to attenuate the English tongue as to degrade the profession of the highway, he not only rode abroad with a fearless courtesy, but handled his own language with the force and spirit of an earlier age.",
    "He wrote with the authority of courage and experience.",
    "A hazardous career had driven envy and malice from his dauntless breast.",
    "Though he confesses a debt to certain 'learned and eminent divines of the Church of England,' he owed a greater debt to his own observation, and he knew-none better-how to recognise with enthusiasm those deeds of daring which only himself has rivalled.",
    "A master of etiquette, he distributed approval and censure with impartial hand; and he was quick to condemn the smallest infraction of an ancient law.",
    "Nor was he insensible to the dignity of history.",
    "The best models were always before him.",
    "With admirable zeal he studied the manner of such masters as Thucydides and Titus Livius of Padua.",
    "Above all, he realised the importance of setting appropriate speeches in the mouths of his characters; and, permitting his heroes to speak for themselves, he imparted to his work an irresistible air of reality and good faith.",
    "His style, always studied, was neither too low nor too high for his subject.",
    "An ill-balanced sentence was as hateful to him as a foul thrust or a stolen advantage.",
    "Abroad a craftsman, he carried into the closet the skill and energy which distinguished him when the moon was on the heath.",
    "Though not born to the arts of peace, he was determined to prove his respect for letters, and his masterpiece is no less pompous in manner than it is estimable in tone and sound in reflection.",
    "He handled slang as one who knew its limits and possibilities, employing it not for the sake of eccentricity, but to give the proper colour and sparkle to his page; indeed, his intimate acquaintance with the vagabonds of speech enabled him to compile a dictionary of Pedlar's French, which has been pilfered by a whole battalion of imitators.",
    "Moreover, there was none of the proverbs of the pavement, those first cousins of slang, that escaped him; and he assumed all the licence of the gentleman-collector in the treatment of his love-passages.",
    "Captain Smith took the justest view of his subject.",
    "For him robbery, in the street as on the highway, was the finest of the arts, and he always revered it for its own sake rather than for vulgar profit.",
    "Though, to deceive the public, he abhorred villainy in word, he never concealed his admiration in deed of a 'highwayman who robs like a gentleman.'",
    "'There is a beauty in all the works of nature,' he observes in one of his wittiest exordia, 'which we are unable to define, though all the world is convinced of its existence: so in every action and station of life there is a grace to be attained, which will make a man pleasing to all about him and serene in his own mind.'",
    "Some there are, he continues, who have placed 'this beauty in vice itself; otherwise it is hardly probable that they could commit so many irregularities with a strong gust and an appearance of satisfaction.'",
    "Notwithstanding that the word 'vice' is used in its conventional sense, we have here the key to Captain Smith's position.",
    "He judged his heroes' achievements with the intelligent impartiality of a connoisseur, and he permitted no other prejudice than an unfailing loyalty to interrupt his opinion.",
    "Though he loved good English as he loved good wine, he was never so happy as when (in imagination) he was tying the legs of a Regicide under the belly of an ass.",
    "And when in the manner of a bookseller's hack he compiled a Comical and Tragical History of the Lives and Adventures of the most noted Bayliffs, adoration of the Royalists persuaded him to miss his chance.",
    "So brave a spirit as himself should not have looked complacently upon the officers of the law, but he saw in the glorification of the bayliff another chance of castigating the Roundheads, and thus he set an honorific crown upon the brow of man's natural enemy.",
    "'These unsanctified rascals,' wrote he, 'would run into any man's debt without paying him, and if their creditors were Cavaliers they thought they had as much right to cheat 'em, as the Israelites had to spoil the Egyptians of their ear-rings and jewels.'",
    "Alas!",
    "the boot was ever on the other leg; and yet you cannot but admire the Captain's valiant determination to sacrifice probability to his legitimate hate.",
    "Of his declining years and death there is no record.",
    "One likes to think of him released from care, and surrounded by books, flowers, and the good things of this earth.",
    "Now and again, maybe, he would muse on the stirring deeds of his youth, and more often he would put away the memory of action to delight in the masterpiece which made him immortal.",
    "He would recall with pleasure, no doubt, the ready praise of Richard Steele, his most appreciative critic, and smile contemptuously at the baseness of his friend and successor, Captain Charles Johnson.",
    "Now, this ingenious writer was wont to boast, when the ale of Fleet Street had empurpled his nose, that he was the most intrepid highwayman of them all.",
    "'Once upon a time,' he would shout, with an arrogant gesture, 'I was known from Blackheath to Hounslow, from Ware to Shooter's Hill.'",
    "And the truth is, the only 'crime' he ever committed was plagiarism.",
    "The self-assumed title of Captain should have deceived nobody, for the braggart never stole anything more difficult of acquisition than another man's words.",
    "He picked brains, not pockets; he committed the greater sin and ran no risk.",
    "He helped himself to the admirable inventions of Captain Smith without apology or acknowledgment, and, as though to lighten the dead-weight of his sin, he never skipped an opportunity of maligning his victim.",
    "Again and again in the very act to steal he will declare vaingloriously that Captain Smith's stories are 'barefaced inventions.'",
    "But doubt was no check to the habit of plunder, and you knew that at every reproach, expressed (so to say) in self-defence, he plied the scissors with the greater energy.",
    "The most cunning theft is the tag which adorns the title-page of his book:                       Little villains oft submit to fate  That great ones may enjoy the world in state.",
    "Thus he quotes from Gay, and you applaud the aptness of the quotation, until you discover that already it was used by Steele in his appreciation of the heroic Smith!",
    "However, Johnson has his uses, and those to whom the masterpiece of Captain Alexander is inaccessible will turn with pleasure to the General History of the lives and adventures of the most Famous Highwaymen, Murderers, Street-Robbers, &c., and will feel no regret that for once they are receiving stolen goods.",
    "Though Johnson fell immeasurably below his predecessor in talent, he manifestly excelled him in scholarship.",
    "A sojourn at the University had supplied him with a fine assortment of Latin tags, and he delighted to prove his erudition by the citation of the Chronicles.",
    "Had he possessed a sense of humour, he might have smiled at the irony of committing a theft upon the historian of thieves.",
    "But he was too vain and too pompous to smile at his own weakness, and thus he would pretend himself a venturesome highwayman, a brave writer, and a profound scholar.",
    "Indeed, so far did his pride carry him, that he would have the world believe him the same Charles Johnson, who wrote The Gentleman Cully and The Successful Pyrate.",
    "Thus with a boastful chuckle he would quote:                       Johnson, who now to sense, now nonsense leaning,  Means not, but blunders round about a meaning   Thus, ignoring the insult, he would plume himself after his drunken fashion that he, too, was an enemy of Pope.",
    "Yet Johnson has remained an example.",
    "For the literature of scoundrelism is as persistent in its form as in its folk-lore.",
    "As Harman's Caveat, which first saw the light in 1566, serves as a model to an unbroken series of such books, as The London Spy, so from Johnson in due course were developed the Newgate Calendar, and those innumerable records, which the latter half of the Eighteenth Century furnished us forth.",
    "The celebrated Calendar was in its origin nothing more than a list of prisoners printed in a folio slip.",
    "But thereafter it became the Malefactor's Bloody Register, which we know.",
    "Its plan and purpose were to improve the occasion.",
    "The thief is no longer esteemed for an artist or appraised upon his merits: he is the awful warning, which shall lead the sinner to repentance.",
    "'Here,' says the preface, 'the giddy thoughtless youth may see as in a mirror the fatal consequences of deviating from virtue'; here he may tremble at the discovery that 'often the best talents are prostituted to the basest purposes.'",
    "But in spite of 'the proper reflections of the whole affair,' the famous Calendar deserved the praise of Borrow.",
    "There is a directness in the narration, which captures all those for whom life and literature are something better than psychologic formul\ufffd.",
    "Moreover, the motives which drive the brigand to his doom are brutal in their simplicity, and withal as genuine and sincere as greed, vanity, and lust can make them.",
    "The true amateur takes pleasure even in the pious exhortations, because he knows that they crawl into their place, lest the hypocrite be scandalised.",
    "But with years the Newgate Calendar also declined, and at last it has followed other dead literatures into the night.",
    "Meanwhile the broadside had enjoyed an unbroken and prosperous career.",
    "Up and down London, up and down England, hurried the Patterer or Flying Stationer.",
    "There was no murder, no theft, no conspiracy, which did not tempt the Gutter Muse to doggerel.",
    "But it was not until James Catnach came up from Alnwick to London (in 1813), that the trade reached the top of its prosperity.",
    "The vast sheets, which he published with their scurvy couplets, and the admirable picture, serving in its time for a hundred executions, have not lost their power to fascinate.",
    "Theirs is the aspect of the early woodcut; the coarse type and the catchpenny headlines are a perpetual delight; as you unfold them, your care keeps pace with your admiration; and you cannot feel them crackle beneath your hand without enthusiasm and without regret.",
    "He was no pedant-Jemmy Catnach; and the image of his ruffians was commonly as far from portraiture, as his verses were remote from poetry.",
    "But he put together in a roughly artistic shape the last murder, robbery, or scandal of the day.",
    "His masterpieces were far too popular to live, and if they knew so vast a circulation as 2,500,000 they are hard indeed to come by.",
    "And now the art is wellnigh dead; though you may discover an infrequent survival in a country town.",
    "But how should Catnach, were he alive to-day, compete with the Special Edition of an evening print?",
    "The decline of the Scoundrel, in fact, has been followed by the disappearance of chap-book and broadside.",
    "The Education Act, which made the cheap novel a necessity, destroyed at a blow the literature of the street.",
    "Since the highwayman wandered, fur-coated, into the City, the patterer has lost his occupation.",
    "Robbery and murder have degenerated into Chinese puzzles, whose solution is a pleasant irritant to the idle brain.",
    "The misunderstanding of Poe has produced a vast polyglot literature, for which one would not give in exchange a single chapter of Captain Smith.",
    "Vautrin and Bill Sykes are already discredited, and it is a false reflection of M. Dupin, which dazzles the eye of a moral and unimaginative world.",
    "Yet the wise man sighs for those fearless days, when the brilliant Macheath rode vizarded down Shooter's Hill, and presently saw his exploits set forth, with the proper accompaniment of a renowned and ancient woodcut, upon a penny broadside.",
    "JAMES HIND, the Master Thief of England, the fearless Captain of the Highway, was born at Chipping Norton in 1618.",
    "His father, a simple saddler, had so poor an appreciation of his son's magnanimity, that he apprenticed him to a butcher; but Hind's destiny was to embrue his hands in other than the blood of oxen, and he had not long endured the restraint of this common craft when forty shillings, the gift of his mother, purchased him an escape, and carried him triumphant and ambitious to London.",
    "Even in his negligent schooldays he had fastened upon a fitting career.",
    "A born adventurer, he sought only enterprise and command: if a commission in the army failed him, then he would risk his neck upon the road, levying his own tax and imposing his own conditions.",
    "To one of his dauntless resolution an opportunity need never have lacked; yet he owed his first preferment to a happy accident.",
    "Surprised one evening in a drunken brawl, he was hustled into the Poultry Counter, and there made acquaintance over a fresh bottle with Robert Allen, one of the chief rogues in the Park, and a ruffian, who had mastered every trick in the game of plunder.",
    "A dexterous cly-faker, an intrepid blade, Allen had also the keenest eye for untested talent, and he detected Hind's shining qualities after the first glass.",
    "No sooner had they paid the price of release, than Hind was admitted of his comrade's gang; he took the oath of fealty, and by way of winning his spurs was bid to hold up a traveller on Shooter's Hill.",
    "Granted his choice of a mount, he straightway took the finest in the stable, with that keen perception of horse-flesh which never deserted him, and he confronted his first victim in the liveliest of humours.",
    "There was no falter in his voice, no hint of inexperience in his manner, when he shouted the battle-cry: 'Stand and deliver!'",
    "The horseman, fearful of his life, instantly surrendered a purse of ten sovereigns, as to the most practised assailant on the road.",
    "Whereupon Hind, with a flourish of ancient courtesy, gave him twenty shillings to bear his charges.",
    "'This,' said he, 'is for handsale sake '; and thus they parted in mutual compliment and content.",
    "Allen was overjoyed at his novice's prowess.",
    "'Did you not see,' he cried to his companions, 'how he robbed him with a grace?'",
    "And well did the trooper deserve his captain's compliment, for his art was perfect from the first.",
    "In bravery as in gallantry he knew no rival, and he plundered with so elegant a style, that only a churlish victim could resent the extortion.",
    "He would as soon have turned his back upon an enemy as demand a purse uncovered.",
    "For every man he had a quip, for every woman a compliment; nor did he ever conceal the truth that the means were for him as important as the end.",
    "Though he loved money, he still insisted that it should be yielded in freedom and good temper; and while he emptied more coaches than any man in England, he was never at a loss for admirers.",
    "Under Allen he served a brilliant apprenticeship.",
    "Enrolled as a servant, he speedily sat at the master's right hand, and his nimble brains devised many a pretty campaign.",
    "For a while success dogged the horse-hoofs of the gang; with wealth came immunity, and not one of the warriors had the misfortune to look out upon the world through a grate.",
    "They robbed with dignity, even with splendour.",
    "Now they would drive forth in a coach and four, carrying with them a whole armoury of offensive weapons; now they would take the road apparelled as noblemen, and attended at a discreet distance by their proper servants.",
    "But recklessness brought the inevitable disaster; and it was no less a personage than Oliver Cromwell who overcame the hitherto invincible Allen.",
    "A handful of the gang attacked Oliver on his way from Huntingdon, but the marauders were outmatched, and the most of them were forced to surrender.",
    "Allen, taken red-handed, swung at Tyburn; Hind, with his better mount and defter horsemanship, rode clear away.",
    "The loss of his friend was a lesson in caution, and henceforth Hind resolved to follow his craft in solitude.",
    "He had embellished his native talent with all the instruction that others could impart, and he reflected that he who rode alone neither ran risk of discovery nor had any need to share his booty.",
    "Thus he began his easy, untrammelled career, making time and space of no account by his rapid, fearless journeys.",
    "Now he was prancing the moors of Yorkshire, now he was scouring the plain between Gloucester and Tewkesbury, but wherever he rode, he had a purse in his pocket and a jest on his tongue.",
    "To recall his prowess is to ride with him (in fancy) under the open sky along the fair, beaten road; to put up with him at the busy, white posthouse, to drink unnumbered pints of mulled sack with the round-bellied landlord, to exchange boastful stories over the hospitable fire, and to ride forth in the morning with the joyous uncertainty of travel upon you.",
    "Failure alone lay outside his experience, and he presently became at once the terror and the hero of England.",
    "Not only was his courage conspicuous; luck also was his constant companion; and a happy bewitchment protected him for three years against the possibility of harm.",
    "He had been lying at Hatfield, at the George Inn, and set out in the early morning for London.",
    "As he neared the town-gate, an old beldame begged an alms of him, and though Hind, not liking her ill-favoured visage, would have spurred forward, the beldame's glittering eye held his horse motionless.",
    "'Good woman,' cried Hind, flinging her a crown, 'I am in haste; pray let me pass.'",
    "'Sir,' answered the witch, 'three days I have awaited your coming.",
    "Would you have me lose my labour now?'",
    "And with Hind's assent the sphinx delivered her message: 'Captain Hind,' said she, 'your life is beset with constant danger, and since from your birth I have wished you well, my poor skill has devised a perfect safeguard.'",
    "With this she gave him a small box containing what might have been a sundial or compass.",
    "'Watch this star,' quoth she, 'and when you know not your road, follow its guidance.",
    "Thus you shall be preserved from every peril for the space of three years.",
    "Thereafter, if you still have faith in my devotion, seek me again, and I will renew the virtue of the charm.'",
    "Hind took the box joyfully; but when he turned to murmur a word of gratitude, the witch struck his nag's flanks with a white wand, the horse leapt vehemently forward, and Hind saw his benefactress no more.",
    "Henceforth, however, a warning voice spoke to him as plainly as did the demon to Socrates; and had he but obeyed the beldame's admonition, he might have escaped a violent death.",
    "For he passed the last day of the third year at the siege of Youghal, where; deprived of happy guidance, he was seriously wounded, and whence he presently regained England to his own undoing.",
    "So long as he kept to the road, his life was one long comedy.",
    "His wit and address were inexhaustible, and fortune never found him at a loss.",
    "He would avert suspicion with the tune of a psalm, as when, habited like a pious shepherd, he broke a traveller's head with his crook, and deprived him of his horse.",
    "An early adventure was to force a pot-valiant parson, who had drunk a cup too much at a wedding, into a rarely farcical situation.",
    "Hind, having robbed two gentlemen's servants of a round sum, went ambling along the road until he encountered a parson.",
    "'Sir,' said he, 'I am closely pursued by robbers.",
    "You, I dare swear, will not stand by and see me plundered.'",
    "Before the parson could protest, he thrust a pistol into his hand, and bade him fire it at the first comer, while he rode off to raise the county.",
    "Meanwhile the rifled travellers came up with the parson, who, straightway, mistaking them for thieves, fired without effect, and then, riding forward, flung the pistol in the face of the nearest.",
    "Thus the parson of the parish was dragged before the magistrate, while Hind, before his dupe could furnish an explanation, had placed many a mile between himself and his adversary.",
    "Though he could on occasion show a clean pair of heels, Hind was never lacking in valiance; and, another day, meeting a traveller with a hundred pounds in his pocket, he challenged him to fight there and then, staked his own horse against the money, and declared that he should win who drew first blood.",
    "'If I am the conqueror,' said the magnanimous Captain, 'I will give you ten pounds for your journey.",
    "If you are favoured of fortune, you shall give me your servant's horse.'",
    "The terms were instantly accepted, and in two minutes Hind had run his adversary through the sword-arm.",
    "But finding that his victim was but a poor squire going to London to pay his composition, he not only returned his money, but sought him out a surgeon, and gave him the best dinner the countryside could afford.",
    "Thus it was his pleasure to act as a providence, many a time robbing Peter to pay Paul, and stripping the niggard that he might indulge his fervent love of generosity.",
    "Of all usurers and bailiffs he had a wholesome horror, and merry was the prank which he played upon the extortionate money-lender of Warwick.",
    "Riding on an easy rein through the town, Hind heard a tumult at a street corner, and inquiring the cause, was told that an innkeeper was arrested by a thievish usurer for a paltry twenty pounds.",
    "Dismounting, this providence in jack-boots discharged the debt, cancelled the bond, and took the innkeeper's goods for his own security.",
    "And thereupon overtaking the usurer, 'My friend!'",
    "he exclaimed, 'I lent you late a sum of twenty pounds.",
    "Repay it at once, or I take your miserable life.'",
    "The usurer was obliged to return the money, with another twenty for interest, and when he would take the law of the innkeeper, was shown the bond duly cancelled, and was flogged wellnigh to death for his pains.",
    "So Hind rode the world up and down, redressing grievances like an Eastern monarch, and rejoicing in the abasement of the evildoer.",
    "Nor was the spirit of his adventure bounded by the ocean.",
    "More than once he crossed the seas; the Hague knew him, and Amsterdam, though these somnolent cities gave small occasion for the display of his talents.",
    "It was from Scilly that he crossed to the Isle of Man, where, being recommended to Lord Derby, he gained high favour, and received in exchange for his jests a comfortable stipend.",
    "Hitherto, said the Chronicles, thieving was unknown in the island.",
    "A man might walk whither he would, a bag of gold in one hand, a switch in the other, and fear no danger.",
    "But no sooner had Hind appeared at Douglas than honest citizens were pilfered at every turn.",
    "In dismay they sought the protection of the Governor, who instantly suspected Hind, and gallantly disclosed his suspicions to the Captain.",
    "'My lord!'",
    "exclaimed Hind, a blush upon his cheek, 'I protest my innocence; but willingly will I suffer the heaviest penalty of your law if I am recognised for the thief.'",
    "The victims, confronted with their robber, knew him not, picturing to the Governor a monster with long hair and unkempt beard.",
    "Hind, acquitted with apologies, fetched from his lodging the disguise of periwig and beard.",
    "'They laugh who win!'",
    "he murmured, and thus forced forgiveness and a chuckle even from his judges.",
    "As became a gentleman-adventurer, Captain Hind was staunch in his loyalty to his murdered King.",
    "To strip the wealthy was always reputable, but to rob a Regicide was a masterpiece of well-doing.",
    "A fervent zeal to lighten Cromwell's pocket had brought the illustrious Allen to the gallows.",
    "But Hind was not one whit abashed, and he would never forego the chance of an encounter with his country's enemies.",
    "His treatment of Hugh Peters in Enfield Chace is among his triumphs.",
    "At the first encounter the Presbyterian plucked up courage enough to oppose his adversary with texts.",
    "To Hind's command of 'Stand and deliver!'",
    "duly enforced with a loaded pistol, the ineffable Peters replied with ox-eye sanctimoniously upturned: 'Thou shalt not steal; let him that stole, steal no more,' adding thereto other variations of the eighth commandment.",
    "Hind immediately countered with exhortations against the awful sin of murder, and rebuked the blasphemy of the Regicides, who, to defend their own infamy, would wrest Scripture from its meaning.",
    "'Did you not, O monster of impiety,' mimicked Hind in the preacher's own voice, 'pervert for your own advantage the words of the Psalmist, who said, \"Bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron\"?",
    "Moreover, was it not Solomon who wrote: \"Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry\"?",
    "And is not my soul hungry for gold and the Regicides' discomfiture?'",
    "Peters was still fumbling after texts when the final argument: 'Deliver thy money, or I will send thee out of the world!'",
    "frightened him into submission, and thirty broad pieces were Hind's reward.",
    "Not long afterwards he confronted Bradshaw near Sherborne, and, having taken from him a purse fat with Jacobuses, he bade the Sergeant stand uncovered while he delivered a discourse upon gold, thus shaped by tradition: 'Ay, marry, sir, this is the metal that wins my heart for ever!",
    "O precious gold, I admire and adore thee as much as Bradshaw, Prynne, or any villain of the same stamp.",
    "This is that incomparable medicament, which the republican physicians call the wonder-working plaster.",
    "It is truly catholic in operation, and somewhat akin to the Jesuit's powder, but more effectual.",
    "The virtues of it are strange and various; it makes justice deaf as well as blind, and takes out spots of the deepest treason more cleverly than castle-soap does common stains; it alters a man's constitution in two or three days, more than the virtuoso's transfusion of blood can do in seven years.",
    "'Tis a great alexiopharmick, and helps poisonous principles of rebellion, and those that use them.",
    "It miraculously exalts and purifies the eyesight, and makes traitors behold nothing but innocence in the blackest malefactors.",
    "'Tis a mighty cordial for a declining cause; it stifles faction or schism, as certainly as the itch is destroyed by butter and brimstone.",
    "In a word, it makes wise men fools, and fools wise men, and both knaves.",
    "The very colour of this precious balm is bright and dazzling.",
    "If it be properly applied to the fist, that is in a decent manner, and a competent dose, it infallibly performs all the cures which the evils of humanity crave.'",
    "Thus having spoken, he killed the six horses of Bradshaw's coach, and went contemptuously on his way.",
    "But he was not a Cavalier merely in sympathy, nor was he content to prove his loyalty by robbing Roundheads.",
    "He, too, would strike a blow for his King, and he showed, first with the royal army in Scotland, and afterwards at Worcester, what he dared in a righteous cause.",
    "Indeed, it was his part in the unhappy battle that cost him his life, and there is a strange irony in the reflection that, on the self-same day whereon Sir Thomas Urquhart lost his precious manuscripts in Worcester's kennels, the neck of James Hind was made ripe for the halter.",
    "His capture was due to treachery.",
    "Towards the end of 1651 he was lodged with one Denzys, a barber, over against St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet Street.",
    "Maybe he had chosen his hiding-place for its neighbourhood to Moll Cutpurse's own sanctuary.",
    "But a pack of traitors discovered him, and haling him before the Speaker of the House of Commons, got him committed forthwith to Newgate.",
    "At first he was charged with theft and murder, and was actually condemned for killing George Sympson at Knole in Berkshire.",
    "But the day after his sentence, an Act of Oblivion was passed, and Hind was put upon trial for treason.",
    "During his examination he behaved with the utmost gaiety, boastfully enlarging upon his services to the King's cause.",
    "'These are filthy jingling spurs,' said he as he left the bar, pointing to the irons about his legs, 'but I hope to exchange them ere long.'",
    "His good-humour remained with him to the end.",
    "He jested in prison as he jested on the road, and it was with a light heart that he mounted the scaffold built for him at Worcester.",
    "His was the fate reserved for traitors: he was hanged, drawn, and quartered, and though his head was privily stolen and buried on the day of execution, his quarters were displayed upon the town walls, until time and the birds destoyed{sic} them utterly.",
    "Thus died the most famous highwayman that ever drew rein upon an English road; and he died the death of a hero.",
    "The unnumbered crimes of violence and robbery wherewith he might have been charged weighed not a feather's weight upon his destiny; he suffered not in the cause of plunder, but in the cause of Charles Stuart.",
    "And in thus excusing his death, his contemporaries did him scant justice.",
    "For while in treasonable loyalty he had a thousand rivals, on the road he was the first exponent of the grand manner.",
    "The middle of the seventeenth century was, in truth, the golden age of the Road.",
    "Not only were all the highwaymen Cavaliers, but many a Cavalier turned highwayman.",
    "Broken at their King's defeat, a hundred captains took pistol and vizard, and revenged themselves as freebooters upon the King's enemies.",
    "And though Hind was outlaw first and royalist afterwards, he was still the most brilliant collector of them all.",
    "If he owed something to his master, Allen, he added from the storehouse of his own genius a host of new precepts, and was the first to establish an enduring tradition.",
    "Before all things he insisted upon courtesy; a guinea stolen by an awkward ruffian was a sorry theft; levied by a gentleman of the highway, it was a tribute paid to courage by generosity.",
    "Nothing would atone for an insult offered to a lady; and when it was Hind's duty to seize part of a gentlewoman's dowry on the Petersfield road, he not only pleaded his necessity in eloquent excuse, but he made many promises on behalf of knight-errantry and damsels in distress.",
    "Never would he extort a trinket to which association had given a sentimental worth; during a long career he never left any man, save a Roundhead, penniless upon the road; nor was it his custom to strip the master without giving the man a trifle for his pains.",
    "His courage, moreover, was equal to his understanding.",
    "Since he was afraid of nothing, it was not his habit to bluster when he was not determined to have his way.",
    "When once his pistol was levelled, when once the solemn order was given, the victim must either fight or surrender; and Hind was never the man to decline a combat with any weapons and in any circumstances.",
    "Like the true artist that he was, he neglected no detail of his craft.",
    "As he was a perfect shot, so also he was a finished horseman; and his skill not only secured him against capture, but also helped him to the theft of such horses as his necessities required, or to the exchange of a worn-out jade for a mettled prancer.",
    "Once upon a time a credulous farmer offered twenty pounds and his own gelding for the Captain's mount.",
    "Hind struck a bargain at once, and as they jogged along the road he persuaded the farmer to set his newly-purchased horse at the tallest hedge, the broadest ditch.",
    "The bumpkin failed, as Hind knew he would fail; and, begging the loan for an instant of his ancient steed, Hind not only showed what horsemanship could accomplish, but straightway rode off with the better horse and twenty pounds in his pocket.",
    "So marvellously did his reputation grow, that it became a distinction to be outwitted by him, and the brains of innocent men were racked to invent tricks which might have been put upon them by the illustrious Captain.",
    "Thus livelier jests and madder exploits were fathered upon him than upon any of his kind, and he has remained for two centuries the prime favourite of the chap-books.",
    "Robbing alone, he could afford to despise pedantry: did he meet a traveller who amused his fancy he would give him the pass-word ('the fiddler's paid,' or what not), as though the highway had not its code of morals; nor did he scruple, when it served his purpose, to rob the bunglers of his own profession.",
    "By this means, indeed, he raised the standard of the Road and warned the incompetent to embrace an easier trade.",
    "While he never took a shilling without sweetening his depredation with a joke, he was, like all humorists, an acute philosopher.",
    "'Remember what I tell you,' he said to the foolish persons who once attempted to rob him, the master-thief of England, 'disgrace not yourself for small sums, but aim high, and for great ones; the least will bring you to the gallows.'",
    "There, in five lines, is the whole philosophy of thieving, and many a poor devil has leapt from the cart to his last dance because he neglected the counsel of the illustrious Hind.",
    "Among his aversions were lawyers and thief-catchers.",
    "'Truly I could wish,' he exclaimed in court, 'that full-fed fees were as little used in England among lawyers as the eating of swine's flesh was among the Jews.'",
    "When you remember the terms of friendship whereon he lived with Moll Cutpurse, his hatred of the thief-catcher, who would hang his brother for 'the lucre of ten pounds, which is the reward,' or who would swallow a false oath 'as easily as one would swallow buttered fish,' is a trifle mysterious.",
    "Perhaps before his death an estrangement divided Hind and Moll.",
    "Was it that the Roaring Girl was too anxious to take the credit of Hind's success?",
    "Or did he harbour the unjust suspicion that when the last descent was made upon him at the barber's, Moll might have given a friendly warning?",
    "Of this he made no confession, but the honest thief was ever a liberal hater of spies and attorneys, and Hind's prudence is unquestioned.",
    "A miracle of intelligence, a master of style, he excelled all his contemporaries and set up for posterity an unattainable standard.",
    "The eighteenth century flattered him by its imitation; but cowardice and swagger compelled it to limp many a dishonourable league behind.",
    "Despite the single inspiration of dancing a corant upon the green, Claude Duval, compared to Hind, was an empty braggart.",
    "Captain Stafford spoiled the best of his effects with a more than brutal vice.",
    "Neither Mull-Sack nor the Golden Farmer, for all their long life and handsome plunder, are comparable for an instant to the robber of Peters and Bradshaw.",
    "They kept their fist fiercely upon the gold of others, and cared not by what artifice it was extorted.",
    "Hind never took a sovereign meanly; he approached no enterprise which he did not adorn.",
    "Living in a true Augustan age, he was a classic among highwaymen, the very Virgil of the Pad.",
    "THE most illustrious woman of an illustrious age, Moll Cutpurse has never lacked the recognition due to her genius.",
    "She was scarce of age when the town devoured in greedy admiration the first record of her pranks and exploits.",
    "A year later Middleton made her the heroine of a sparkling comedy.",
    "Thereafter she became the favourite of the rufflers, the commonplace of the poets.",
    "Newgate knew her, and Fleet Street; her manly figure was as familiar in the Bear Garden as at the Devil Tavern; courted alike by the thief and his victim, for fifty years she lived a life brilliant as sunlight, many-coloured as a rainbow.",
    "And she is remembered, after the lapse of centuries, not only as the Queen-Regent of Misrule, the benevolent tyrant of cly-filers and heavers, of hacks and blades, but as the incomparable Roaring Girl, free of the playhouse, who perchance presided with Ben Jonson over the Parliament of Wits.",
    "She was born in the Barbican at the heyday of England's greatness, four years after the glorious defeat of the Armada, and had to her father an honest shoemaker.",
    "She came into the world (saith rumour) with her fist doubled, and even in the cradle gave proof of a boyish, boisterous disposition.",
    "Her girlhood, if the word be not an affront to her mannish character, was as tempestuous as a wind-blown petticoat.",
    "A very 'tomrig and rump-scuttle,' she knew only the sports of boys: her war-like spirit counted no excuse too slight for a battle; and so valiant a lad was she of her hands, so well skilled in cudgel-play, that none ever wrested a victory from fighting Moll.",
    "While other girls were content to hem a kerchief or mark a sampler, Moll would escape to the Bear Garden, and there enjoy the sport of baiting, whose loyal patron she remained unto the end.",
    "That which most bitterly affronted her was the magpie talk of the wenches.",
    "'Why,' she would ask in a fury of indignation, 'why crouch over the fire with a pack of gossips, when the highway invites you to romance?",
    "Why finger a distaff, when a quarterstaff comes more aptly to your hand?'",
    "And thus she grew in age and stature, a stranger to the soft delights of her sex, her heart still deaf to the trivial voice of love.",
    "Had not a wayward accident cumbered her with a kirtle, she would have sought death or glory in the wars; she would have gone with Colonel Downe's men upon the road; she would have sailed to the Spanish Main for pieces of eight.",
    "But the tyranny of womanhood was as yet supreme, and the honest shoemaker, ignorant of his daughter's talent, bade her take service at a respectable saddler's, and thus suppress the frowardness of her passion.",
    "Her rebellion was instant.",
    "Never would she abandon the sword and the wrestling-booth for the harmless bodkin and the hearthstone of domesticity.",
    "Being absolute in refusal, she was kidnapped by her friends and sent on board a ship, bound for Virginia and slavery.",
    "There, in the dearth of womankind, even so sturdy a wench as Moll might have found a husband; but the enterprise was little to her taste, and, always resourceful, she escaped from shipboard before the captain had weighed his anchor.",
    "Henceforth she resolved her life should be free and chainless as the winds.",
    "Never more should needle and thread tempt her to a womanish inactivity.",
    "As Hercules, whose counterpart she was, changed his club for the distaff of Omphale, so would she put off the wimple and bodice of her sex for jerkin and galligaskins.",
    "If she could not allure manhood, then would she brave it.",
    "And though she might not cross swords with her country's foes, at least she might levy tribute upon the unjustly rich, and confront an enemy wherever there was a full pocket.",
    "Her entrance into a gang of thieves was beset by no difficulty.",
    "The Bear Garden, always her favourite resort, had made her acquainted with all the divers and rumpads of the town.",
    "The time, moreover, was favourable to enterprise, and once again was genius born into a golden age.",
    "The cutting of purses was an art brought to perfection, and already the more elegant practice of picking pockets was understood.",
    "The transition gave scope for endless ingenuity, and Moll was not slow in mastering the theory of either craft.",
    "It was a changing fashion of dress, as I have said, which forced a new tactic upon the thief; the pocket was invented because the hanging purse was too easy a prey for the thievish scissors.",
    "And no sooner did the world conceal its wealth in pockets than the cly-filer was born to extract the booty with his long, nimble fingers.",
    "The trick was managed with an admirable forethought, which has been a constant example to after ages.",
    "The file was always accompanied by a bull, whose duty it was to jostle and distract the victim while his pockets were rifled.",
    "The bung, or what not, was rapidly passed on to the attendant rub, who scurried off before the cry of STOP THIEF!",
    "could be raised.",
    "Thus was the craft of thieving practised when Moll was enrolled a humble member of the gang.",
    "Yet nature had not endowed her with the qualities which ensure an active triumph.",
    "'The best signs and marks of a happy, industrious hand,' wrote the hoyden, 'is a long middle finger, equally suited with that they call the fool's or first finger.'",
    "Now, though she was never a clumsy jade, the practice of sword-play and quarterstaff had not refined the industry of her hands, which were the rather framed for strength than for delicacy.",
    "So that though she served a willing apprenticeship, and eagerly shared the risks of her chosen trade, the fear of Newgate and Tyburn weighed heavily upon her spirit, and she cast about her for a method of escape.",
    "Avoiding the danger of discovery, she was loth to forego her just profit, and hoped that intelligence might atone for her sturdy, inactive fingers.",
    "Already she had endeared herself to the gang by unnumbered acts of kindness and generosity; already her inflexible justice had made her umpire in many a difficult dispute.",
    "If a rascal could be bought off at the gallows' foot, there was Moll with an open purse; and so speedily did she penetrate all the secrets of thievish policy, that her counsel and comfort were soon indispensable.",
    "Here, then, was her opportunity.",
    "Always a diplomatist rather than a general, she gave up the battlefield for the council chamber.",
    "She planned the robberies which defter hands achieved; and, turning herself from cly-filer to fence, she received and changed to money all the watches and trinkets stolen by the gang.",
    "Were a citizen robbed upon the highway, he straightway betook himself to Moll, and his property was presently returned him at a handsome price.",
    "Her house, in short, became a brokery.",
    "Hither the blades and divers brought their purchases, and sought the ransom; hither came the outraged victims to buy again the jewels and rings which thievish fingers had pinched.",
    "With prosperity her method improved, until at last her statesmanship controlled the remotest details of the craft.",
    "Did one of her gang get to work overnight and carry off a wealthy swag, she had due intelligence of the affair betimes next morning, so that, furnished with an inventory of the booty, she might make a just division, or be prepared for the advent of the rightful owner.",
    "So she gained a complete ascendency over her fellows.",
    "And when once her position was assured, she came forth a pitiless autocrat.",
    "Henceforth the gang existed for her pleasure, not she for the gang's; and she was as urgent to punish insubordination as is an empress to avenge the heinous sin of treason.",
    "The pickpocket who had claimed her protection knew no more the delight of freedom.",
    "If he dared conceal the booty that was his, he had an enemy more powerful than the law, and many a time did contumacy pay the last penalty at the gallows.",
    "But the faithful also had their reward, for Moll never deserted a comrade, and while she lived in perfect safety herself she knew well how to contrive the safety of others.",
    "Nor was she content merely to discharge those duties of the fence for which an instinct of statecraft designed her.",
    "Her restless brain seethed with plans of plunder, and if her hands were idle it was her direction that emptied half the pockets in London.",
    "Having drilled her army of divers to an unparalleled activity, she cast about for some fresh method of warfare, and so enrolled a regiment of heavers, who would lurk at the mercers' doors for an opportunity to carry off ledgers and account-books.",
    "The price of redemption was fixed by Moll herself, and until the mercers were aroused by frequent losses to a quicker vigilance, the trade was profitably secure.",
    "Meanwhile new clients were ever seeking her aid, and, already empress of the thieves, she presently aspired to the friendship and patronage of the highwaymen.",
    "Though she did not dispose of their booty, she was appointed their banker, and vast was the treasure entrusted to the coffers of honest Moll.",
    "Now, it was her pride to keep only the best company, for she hated stupidity worse than a clumsy hand, and they were men of wit and spirit who frequented her house.",
    "Thither came the famous Captain Hind, the Regicides' inveterate enemy, whose lofty achievements Moll, with an amiable extravagance, was wont to claim for her own.",
    "Thither came the unamiably notorious Mull Sack, who once emptied Cromwell's pocket on the Mall, and whose courage was as formidable as his rough-edged tongue.",
    "Another favourite was the ingenious Crowder, whose humour it was to take the road habited like a bishop, and who surprised the victims of his greed with ghostly counsel.",
    "Thus it was a merry party that assembled in the lady's parlour, loyal to the memory of the martyred king, and quick to fling back an offending pleasantry.",
    "But the house in Fleet Street was a refuge as well as a resort, the sanctuary of a hundred rascals, whose misdeeds were not too flagrantly discovered.",
    "For, while Moll always allowed discretion to govern her conduct, while she would risk no present security for a vague promise of advantages to come, her secret influence in Newgate made her more powerful than the hangman and the whole bench of judges.",
    "There was no turnkey who was not her devoted servitor, but it was the clerk of Newgate to whom she and her family were most deeply beholden.",
    "This was one Ralph Briscoe, as pretty a fellow as ever deserted the law for a bull-baiting.",
    "Though wizened and clerkly in appearance, he was of a lofty courage; and Moll was heard to declare that had she not been sworn to celibacy, she would have cast an eye upon the faithful Ralph, who was obedient to her behests whether at Gaol Delivery or Bear Garden.",
    "For her he would pack a jury or get a reprieve; for him she would bait a bull with the fiercest dogs in London.",
    "Why then should she fear the law, when the clerk of Newgate and Gregory the Hangman fought upon her side?",
    "For others the arbiter of life and death, she was only thrice in an unexampled career confronted with the law.",
    "Her first occasion of arrest was so paltry that it brought discredit only on the constable.",
    "This jack-in-office, a very Dogberry, encountered Moll returning down Ludgate Hill from some merry-making, a lanthorn carried pompously before her.",
    "Startled by her attire he questioned her closely, and receiving insult for answer, promptly carried her to the Round House.",
    "The customary garnish made her free or the prison, and next morning a brief interview with the Lord Mayor restored Moll to liberty but not to forgetfulness.",
    "She had yet to wreak her vengeance upon the constable for a monstrous affront, and hearing presently that he had a rich uncle in Shropshire, she killed the old gentleman (in imagination) and made the constable his heir.",
    "Instantly a retainer, in the true garb and accent of the country, carried the news to Dogberry, and sent him off to Ludlow on the costliest of fool's errands.",
    "He purchased a horse and set forth joyously, as became a man of property; he limped home, broken in purse and spirit, the hapless object of ridicule and contempt.",
    "Perhaps he guessed the author of this sprightly outrage; but Moll, for her part, was far too finished a humorist to reveal the truth, and hereafter she was content to swell the jesting chorus.",
    "Her second encounter with justice was no mere pleasantry, and it was only her marvellous generalship that snatched her career from untimely ruin and herself from the clutch of Master Gregory.",
    "Two of her emissaries had encountered a farmer in Chancery Lane.",
    "They spoke with him first at Smithfield, and knew that his pocket was well lined with bank-notes.",
    "An improvised quarrel at a tavern-door threw the farmer off his guard, and though he defended the money, his watch was snatched from his fob and duly carried to Moll.",
    "The next day the victim, anxious to repurchase his watch, repaired to Fleet Street, where Moll generously promised to recover the stolen property.",
    "Unhappily security had encouraged recklessness, and as the farmer turned to leave he espied his own watch hanging among other trinkets upon the wall.",
    "With a rare discretion he held his peace until he had called a constable to his aid, and this time the Roaring Girl was lodged in Newgate, with an ugly crime laid to her charge.",
    "Committed for trial, she demanded that the watch should be left in the constable's keeping, and, pleading not guilty when the sessions came round, insisted that her watch and the farmer's were not the same.",
    "The farmer, anxious to acknowledge his property, demanded the constable to deliver the watch, that it might be sworn to in open court; and when the constable put his hand to his pocket the only piece of damning evidence had vanished, stolen by the nimble fingers of one of Moll's officers.",
    "Thus with admirable trickery and a perfect sense of dramatic effect she contrived her escape, and never again ran the risk of a sudden discovery.",
    "For experience brought caution in its train, and though this wiliest of fences lived almost within the shadow of Newgate, though she was as familiar in the prison yard as at the Globe Tavern, her nightly resort, she obeyed the rules of life and law with so precise an exactitude that suspicion could never fasten upon her.",
    "Her kingdom was midway between robbery and justice.",
    "And as she controlled the mystery of thieving so, in reality, she meted out punishment to the evildoer.",
    "Honest citizens were robbed with small risk to life or property.",
    "For Moll always frowned upon violence, and was ever ready to restore the booty for a fair ransom.",
    "And the thieves, driven by discipline to a certain humanity, plied their trade with an obedience and orderliness hitherto unknown.",
    "Moll's then was no mean achievement.",
    "Her career was not circumscribed by her trade, and the Roaring Girl, the daredevil companion of the wits and bloods, enjoyed a fame no less glorious than the Queen of Thieves.",
    "'Enter Moll in a frieze jerkin and a black safeguard.'",
    "Thus in the old comedy she comes upon the stage; and truly it was by her clothes that she was first notorious.",
    "By accident a woman, by habit a man, she must needs invent a costume proper to her pursuits.",
    "But she was no shrieking reformer, no fanatic spying regeneration in a pair of breeches.",
    "Only in her attire she showed her wit; and she went to a bull-baiting in such a dress as well became her favourite sport.",
    "She was not of those who 'walk in spurs but never ride.'",
    "The jerkin, the doublet, the galligaskins were put on to serve the practical purposes of life, not to attract the policeman or the spinster.",
    "And when a petticoat spread its ample folds beneath the doublet, not only was her array handsome, but it symbolised the career of one who was neither man nor woman, and yet both.",
    "After a while, however, the petticoat seemed too tame for her stalwart temper, and she exchanged it for the great Dutch slop, habited in which unseemly garment she is pictured in the ancient prints.",
    "Up and down the town she romped and scolded, earning the name which Middleton gave her in her green girlhood.",
    "'She has the spirit of four great parishes,' says the wit in the comedy, 'and a voice that will drown all the city.'",
    "If a gallant stood in the way, she drew upon him in an instant, and he must be a clever swordsman to hold his ground against the tomboy who had laid low the German fencer himself.",
    "A good fellow always, she had ever a merry word for the passer-by, and so sharp was her tongue that none ever put a trick upon her.",
    "Not to know Moll was to be inglorious, and she 'slipped from one company to another like a fat eel between a Dutchman's fingers.'",
    "Now at Parker's Ordinary, now at the Bear Garden, she frequented only the haunts of men, and not until old age came upon her did she endure patiently the presence of women.",
    "Her voice and speech were suited to the galligaskin.",
    "She was a true disciple of Maltre Fran\ufffdois, hating nothing so much as mincing obscenity, and if she flavoured her discourse with many a blasphemous quip, the blasphemy was 'not so malicious as customary.'",
    "Like the blood she was, she loved good ale and wine; and she regarded it among her proudest titles to renown that she was the first of women to smoke tobacco.",
    "Many was the pound of best Virginian that she bought of Mistress Gallipot, and the pipe, with monkey, dog, and eagle, is her constant emblem.",
    "Her antic attire, the fearless courage of her pranks, now and again involved her in disgrace or even jeopardised her freedom; but her unchanging gaiety made light of disaster, and still she laughed and rollicked in defiance of prude and pedant.",
    "Her companion in many a fantastical adventure was Banks, the vintner of Cheapside, that same Banks who taught his horse to dance and shod him with silver.",
    "Now once upon a time a right witty sport was devised between them.",
    "The vintner bet Moll \ufffd20 that she would not ride from Charing Cross to Shoreditch astraddle on horseback, in breeches and doublet, boots and spurs.",
    "The hoyden took him up in a moment, and added of her own devilry a trumpet and banner.",
    "She set out from Charing Cross bravely enough, and a trumpeter being an unwonted spectacle, the eyes of all the town were clapped upon her.",
    "Yet none knew her until she reached Bishopsgate, where an orange-wench set up the cry, 'Moll Cutpurse on horseback!'",
    "Instantly the cavalier was surrounded by a noisy mob.",
    "Some would have torn her from the saddle for an imagined insult upon womanhood, others, more wisely minded, laughed at the prank with good-humoured merriment.",
    "Every minute the throng grew denser, and it had fared hardly with roystering Moll, had not a wedding and the arrest of a debtor presently distracted the gaping idlers.",
    "As the mob turned to gaze at the fresh wonder, she spurred her horse until she gained Newington by an unfrequented lane.",
    "There she waited until night should cover her progress to Shoreditch, and thus peacefully she returned home to lighten the vintner's pocket of twenty pounds.",
    "The fame of the adventure spread abroad, and that the scandal should not be repeated Moll was summoned before the Court of Arches to answer a charge of appearing publicly in mannish apparel.",
    "The august tribunal had no terror for her, and she received her sentence to do penance in a white sheet at Paul's Cross during morning-service on a Sunday with an audacious contempt.",
    "'They might as well have shamed a black dog as me,' she proudly exclaimed; and why should she dread the white sheet, when all the spectators looked with a lenient eye upon her professed discomfiture?'",
    "For a halfpenny,' she said, 'she would have travelled to every market-town of England in the guise of a penitent,' and having tippled off three quarts of sack she swaggered to Paul's Cross in the maddest of humours.",
    "But not all the courts on earth could lengthen her petticoat, or contract the Dutch slop by a single fold.",
    "For a while, perhaps, she chastened her costume, yet she soon reverted to the ancient mode, and to her dying day went habited as a man.",
    "As bear baiting was the passion of her life, so she was scrupulous in the care and training of her dogs.",
    "She gave them each a trundle-bed, wrapping them from the cold in sheets and blankets, while their food would not have dishonoured a gentleman's table.",
    "Parrots, too, gave a sense of colour and companionship to her house; and it was in this love of pets, and her devotion to cleanliness, that she showed a trace of dormant womanhood.",
    "Abroad a ribald and a scold, at home she was the neatest of housewives, and her parlour, with its mirrors and its manifold ornaments, was the envy of the neighbours.",
    "So her trade flourished, and she lived a life of comfort, of plenty even, until the Civil War threw her out of work.",
    "When an unnatural conflict set the whole country at loggerheads, what occasion was there for the honest prig?",
    "And it is not surprising that, like all the gentlemen adventurers of the age, Moll remained most stubbornly loyal to the King's cause.",
    "She made the conduit in Fleet Street run with wine when Charles came to London in 1638; and it was her amiable pleasantry to give the name of Strafford to a clever, cunning bull, and to dub the dogs that assailed him Pym, Hampden, and the rest, that right heartily she might applaud the courage of Strafford as he threw off his unwary assailants.",
    "So long as the quarrel lasted, she was compelled to follow a profession more ancient than the fence's; for there is one passion which war itself cannot extinguish.",
    "When once the King had laid his head 'down as upon a bed,' when once the Protector had proclaimed his supremacy, the industry of the road revived; and there was not a single diver or rumpad that did not declare eternal war upon the black-hearted Regicides.",
    "With a laudable devotion to her chosen cause, Moll despatched the most experienced of her gang to rob Lady Fairfax on her way to church; and there is a tradition that the Roaring Girl, hearing that Fairfax himself would pass by Hounslow, rode forth to meet him, and with her own voice bade him stand and deliver.",
    "One would like to believe it; yet it is scarce credible.",
    "If Fairfax had spent the balance of an ignominious career in being plundered by a band of loyal brigands, he would not have had time to justify the innumerable legends of pockets emptied and pistols levelled at his head.",
    "Moreover, Moll herself was laden with years, and she had always preferred the council chamber to the battlefield.",
    "But it is certain that, with Captain Hind and Mull Sack to aid, she schemed many a clever plot against the Roundheads, and nobly she played her part in avenging the martyred King.",
    "Thus she declined into old age, attended, like Queen Mary, by her maids, who would card, reel, spin, and beguile her leisure with sweet singing.",
    "Though her spirit was untamed, the burden of her years compelled her to a tranquil life.",
    "She, who formerly never missed a bull-baiting, must now content herself with tick-tack.",
    "Her fortune, moreover, had been wrecked in the Civil War.",
    "Though silver shells still jingled in her pocket, time was she knew the rattle of the yellow boys.",
    "But she never lost courage, and died at last of a dropsy, in placid contentment with her lot.",
    "Assuredly she was born at a time well suited to her genius.",
    "Had she lived to-day, she might have been a 'Pioneer'; she might even have discussed some paltry problem of sex in a printed obscenity.",
    "In her own freer, wiser age, she was not man's detractor, but his rival; and if she never knew the passion of love, she was always loyal to the obligation of friendship.",
    "By her will she left twenty pounds to celebrate the Second Charles's restoration to his kingdom; and you contemplate her career with the single regret that she died a brief year before the red wine, thus generously bestowed, bubbled at the fountain.",
    "WHEN Jonathan Wild and the Count La Ruse, in Fielding's narrative, took a hand at cards, Jonathan picked his opponent's pocket, though he knew it was empty, while the Count, from sheer force of habit, stacked the cards, though Wild had not a farthing to lose.",
    "And if in his uncultured youth the great man stooped to prig with his own hand, he was early cured of the weakness: so that Fielding's picture of the hero taking a bottle-screw from the Ordinary's pocket in the very moment of death is entirely fanciful.",
    "For 'this Machiavel of Thieves,' as a contemporary styled him, left others to accomplish what his ingenuity had planned.",
    "His was the high policy of theft.",
    "If he lived on terms of familiar intimacy with the mill-kens, the bridle-culls, the buttock-and-files of London, he was none the less the friend and minister of justice.",
    "He enjoyed the freedom of Newgate and the Old Bailey.",
    "He came and went as he liked: he packed juries, he procured bail, he manufactured evidence; and there was scarce an assize or a sessions passed but he slew his man.",
    "The world knew him for a robber, yet could not refuse his brilliant service.",
    "At the Poultry Counter, you are told, he laid the foundations of his future greatness, and to the Poultry Counter he was committed for some trifling debt ere he had fully served his apprenticeship to the art and mystery of buckle-making.",
    "There he learned his craft, and at his enlargement he was able forthwith to commence thief-catcher.",
    "His plan was conceived with an effrontery that was nothing less than genius.",
    "On the one side he was the factor, or rather the tyrant, of the cross-coves: on the other he was the trusted agent of justice, the benefactor of the outraged and the plundered.",
    "Among his earliest exploits was the recovery of the Countess of G-d-n's chair, impudently carried off when her ladyship had but just alighted; and the courage wherewith he brought to justice the murderers of one Mrs. Knap, who had been slain for some trifling booty, established his reputation as upon a rock.",
    "He at once advertised himself in the public prints as Thief-Catcher General of Great Britain and Ireland, and proceeded to send to the gallows every scoundrel that dared dispute his position.",
    "His opportunities of gain were infinite.",
    "Even if he did not organise the robbery which his cunning was presently to discover, he had spies in every hole and corner to set him on the felon's track.",
    "Nor did he leave a single enterprise to chance: 'He divided the city and suburbs into wards or divisions, and appointed the persons who were to attend each ward, and kept them strictly to their duty.'",
    "If a subordinate dared to disobey or to shrink from murder, Jonathan hanged him at the next assize, and happily for him he had not a single confederate whose neck he might not put in the halter when he chose.",
    "Thus he preserved the union and the fidelity of his gang, punishing by judicial murder the smallest insubordination, the faintest suspicion of rivalry.",
    "Even when he had shut his victim up in Newgate, he did not leave him so long as there was a chance of blackmail.",
    "He would make the most generous offers of evidence and defence to every thief that had a stiver left him.",
    "But whether or not he kept his bargain-that depended upon policy and inclination.",
    "On one occasion, when he had brought a friend to the Old Bailey, and relented at the last moment, he kept the prosecutor drunk from the noble motive of self-interest, until the case was over.",
    "And so esteemed was he of the officers of the law that even this interference did but procure a reprimand.",
    "His meanest action marked him out from his fellows, but it was not until he habitually pillaged the treasures he afterwards restored to their grateful owners for a handsome consideration, that his art reached the highest point of excellence.",
    "The event was managed by him with amazing adroitness from beginning to end.",
    "It was he who discovered the wealth and habit of the victim; it was he who posted the thief and seized the plunder, giving a paltry commission to his hirelings for the trouble; it was he who kept whatever valuables were lost in the transaction; and as he was the servant of the Court, discovery or inconvenience was impossible.",
    "Surely the Machiavel of Thieves is justified of his title.",
    "He was known to all the rich and titled folk in town; and if he was generally able to give them back their stolen valuables at something more than double their value, he treated his clients with a most proper insolence.",
    "When Lady M-n was unlucky enough to lose a silver buckle at Windsor, she asked Wild to recover it, and offered the hero twenty pounds for his trouble.",
    "'Zounds, Madam,' says he, 'you offer nothing.",
    "It cost the gentleman who took it forty pounds for his coach, equipage, and other expenses to Windsor.'",
    "His impudence increased with success, and in the geniality of his cups he was wont to boast his amazing rogueries: 'hinting not without vanity at the poor Understandings of the Greatest Part of Mankind, and his own Superior Cunning.'",
    "In fifteen years he claimed \ufffd10,000 for his dividend of recovered plunderings, and who shall estimate the moneys which flowed to his treasury from blackmail and the robberies of his gang?",
    "So brisk became his trade in jewels and the precious metals that he opened relations with Holland, and was master of a fleet.",
    "His splendour increased with wealth: he carried a silver-mounted sword, and a footman tramped at his heels.",
    "'His table was very splendid,' says a biographer: 'he seldom dining under five Dishes, the Reversions whereof were generally charitably bestow'd on the Commonside felons.'",
    "At his second marriage with Mrs. Mary D-n, the hempen widow of Scull D-n, his humour was most happily expressed: he distributed white ribbons among the turnkeys, he gave the Ordinary gloves and favours, he sent the prisoners of Newgate several ankers of brandy for punch.",
    "'Twas a fitting complaisance, since his fortune was drawn from Newgate, and since he was destined himself, a few years later, to drink punch-'a liquor nowhere spoken against in the Scriptures'-with the same Ordinary whom he thus magnificently decorated.",
    "Endowed with considerable courage, for a while he had the prudence to save his skin, and despite his bravado he was known on occasion to yield a plundered treasure to an accomplice who set a pistol to his head.",
    "But it is certain that the accomplice died at Tyburn for his pains, and on equal terms Jonathan was resolute with the best.",
    "On the trail he was savage as a wild beast.",
    "When he arrested James Wright for a robbery committed upon the persons of the Earl of B-l-n and the Lord Bruce, he held on to the victim's chin by his teeth-an exploit which reminds you of the illustrious Tiger Roche.",
    "Even in his lifetime he was generously styled the Great.",
    "The scourge of London, he betrayed and destroyed every man that ever dared to live upon terms of friendship with him.",
    "It was Jonathan that made Blueskin a thief, and Jonathan screened his creature from justice only so long as clemency seemed profitable.",
    "At the first hint of disobedience Blueskin was committed to Newgate.",
    "When he had stood his trial, and was being taken to the Condemned Hole, he beckoned to Wild as though to a conference, and cut his throat with a penknife.",
    "The assembled rogues and turnkeys thought their Jonathan dead at last, and rejoiced exceedingly therein.",
    "Straightway the poet of Newgate's Garland leaped into verse:                           Then hopeless of life,  He drew his penknife,  And made a sad widow of Jonathan's wife.",
    "But forty pounds paid her, her grief shall appease,  And every man round me may rob, if he please.",
    "But Jonathan recovered, and Molly, his wife, was destined a second time to win the conspicuous honour that belongs to a hempen widow.",
    "As his career drew to its appointed close, Fortune withheld her smiles.",
    "'People got so peery,' complained the great man, 'that ingenious men were put to dreadful shifts.'",
    "And then, highest tribute to his greatness, an Act of Parliament was passed which made it a capital offence 'for a prig to steal with the hands of other people'; and in the increase of public vigilance his undoing became certain.",
    "On the 2nd of January, 1725, a day not easy to forget, a creature of Wild's spoke with fifty yards of lace, worth \ufffd40, at his Captain's bidding, and Wild, having otherwise disposed of the plunder, was charged on the 10th of March that he 'did feloniously receive of Katharine Stetham ten guineas on account and under colour of helping the said Katharine Stetham to the said lace again, and did not then, nor any time since, discover or apprehend, or cause to be apprehended and brought to Justice, the persons that committed the said felony.'",
    "Thus runs the indictment, and, to the inexpressible relief of lesser men, Jonathan Wild was condemned to the gallows.",
    "Thereupon he had serious thoughts of 'putting his house in order'; with an ironical smile he demanded an explanation of the text: 'Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree'; but, presently reflecting that 'his Time was but short in this World, he improved it to the best advantage in Eating, Drinking, Swearing, Cursing, and talking to his Visitants.'",
    "For all his bragging, drink alone preserved his courage: 'he was very restless in the Condemned Hole,' though 'he gave little or no attention to the condemned Sermon which the purblind Ordinary preached before him,' and which was, in Fielding's immortal phrase, 'unto the Greeks foolishness.'",
    "But in the moment of death his distinction returned to him.",
    "He tried, and failed, to kill himself; and his progress to the nubbing cheat was a triumph of execration.",
    "He reached Tyburn through a howling mob, and died to a yell of universal joy.",
    "The Ordinary has left a record so precious and so lying, that it must needs be quoted at length.",
    "The great Thief-Catcher's confession is a masterpiece of comfort, and is so far removed from the truth as completely to justify Fielding's incomparable creation.",
    "'Finding there was no room for mercy (and how could I expect mercy, who never showed any)'-thus does the devil dodger dishonour our Jonathan's memory!-'as soon as I came into the Condemned Hole, I began to think of making a preparation for my soul.",
    ".",
    ".",
    ".",
    "To part with my wife, my dear Molly, is so great an Affliction to me, that it touches me to the Quick, and is like Daggers entering into my Heart.'",
    "How tame the Ordinary's falsehood to the brilliant invention of Fielding, who makes Jonathan kick his Tishy in the very shadow of the Tree!",
    "And the Reverend Gentleman gains in unction as he goes: 'In the Cart they all kneeled down to prayers and seemed very penitent; the Ordinary used all the means imaginable to make them think of another World, and after singing a penitential Psalm, they cry'd Lord Jesus Christ receive our Souls, the cart drew away and they were all turned off.",
    "This is as good an account as can be given by me.'",
    "Poor Ordinary!",
    "If he was modest, he was also untruthful, and you are certain that it was not thus the hero met his death.",
    "Even had Fielding never written his masterpiece, Jonathan Wild would still have been surnamed 'The Great.'",
    "For scarce a chap-book appeared in the year of Jonathan's death that did not expose the only right and true view of his character.",
    "'His business,' says one hack of prison literature, 'at all times was to put a false gloss upon things, and to make fools of mankind.'",
    "Another precisely formulates the theory of greatness insisted upon by Fielding with so lavish an irony and so masterly a wit.",
    "While it is certain that The History of the Late Mr. Jonathan Wild is as noble a piece of irony as literature can show, while for the qualities of wit and candour it is equal to its motive, it is likewise true that therein you meet the indubitable Jonathan Wild.",
    "It is an entertainment to compare the chap-books of the time with the reasoned, finished work of art: not in any spirit of pedantry-since accuracy in these matters is of small account, but with intent to show how doubly fortunate Fielding was in his genius and in his material.",
    "Of course the writer rejoiced in the aid of imagination and eloquence; of course he embellished his picture with such inspirations as Miss Laetitia and the Count; of course he preserves from the first page to the last the highest level of unrivalled irony.",
    "But the sketch was there before him, and a lawyer's clerk had treated Jonathan in a vein of heroism within a few weeks of his death.",
    "And since a plain statement is never so true as fiction, Fielding's romance is still more credible, still convinces with an easier effort, than the serious and pedestrian records of contemporaries.",
    "Nor can you return to its pages without realising that, so far from being 'the evolution of a purely intellectual conception,' Jonathan Wild is a magnificently idealised and ironical portrait of a great man.",
    "THEY plied the same trade, each with incomparable success.",
    "By her, as by him, the art of the fence was carried to its ultimate perfection.",
    "In their hands the high policy of theft wanted nor dignity nor assurance.",
    "Neither harboured a single scheme which was not straightway translated into action, and they were masters at once of Newgate and the Highway.",
    "As none might rob without the encouragement of his emperor, so none was hanged at Tyburn while intrigue or bribery might avail to drag a half-doomed neck from the halter; and not even Moll herself was more bitterly tyrannical in the control of a reckless gang than the thin-jawed, hatchet-faced Jonathan Wild.",
    "They were statesmen rather than warriors-happy if they might direct the enterprises of others, and determined to punish the lightest disobedience by death.",
    "The mind of each was readier than his right arm, and neither would risk an easy advantage by a misunderstood or unwonted sleight of hand.",
    "But when you leave the exercise of their craft to contemplate their character with a larger eye, it is the woman who at every point has the advantage.",
    "Not only was she the peerless inventor of a new cunning; she was at home (and abroad) the better fellow.",
    "The suppression of sex was in itself an unparalleled triumph, and the most envious detractor could not but marvel at the domination of her womanhood.",
    "Moreover, she shone in a gayer, more splendid epoch.",
    "The worthy contemporary of Shakespeare, she had small difficulty in performing feats of prowess and resource which daunted the intrepid ruffians of the eighteenth century.",
    "Her period, in brief, gave her an eternal superiority; and it were as hopeless for Otway to surpass the master whom he disgraced, as for Wild to o'ershadow the brilliant example of Moll Cutpurse.",
    "Tyrants both, they exercised their sovereignty in accordance with their varying temperament.",
    "Hers was a fine, fat, Falstaffian humour, which, while it inspired Middleton, might have suggested to Shakespeare an equal companion of the drunken knight.",
    "His was but a narrow, cynic wit, not edged like the knife, which wellnigh cut his throat, but blunt and scratching like a worn-toothed saw.",
    "She laughed with a laugh that echoed from Ludgate to Charing Cross, and her voice drowned all the City.",
    "He grinned rarely and with malice; he piped in a voice shrill and acid as the tricks of his mischievous imagination.",
    "She knew no cruelty beyond the necessities of her life, and none regretted more than she the inevitable death of a traitor.",
    "He lusted after destruction with a fiendish temper, which was a grim anticipation of De Sade; he would even smile as he saw the noose tighten round the necks of the poor innocents he had beguiled to Tyburn.",
    "It was his boast that he had contrived robberies for the mere glory of dragging his silly victims to the gallows.",
    "But Moll, though she stood half-way between the robber and his prey, would have sacrificed a hundred well-earned commissions rather than see her friends and comrades strangled.",
    "Her temperament compelled her to the loyal support of her own order, and she would have shrunk in horror from her rival, who, for all his assumed friendship with the thief, was a staunch and subtle ally of justice.",
    "Before all things she had the genius of success.",
    "Her public offences were trivial and condoned.",
    "She died in her bed, full of years and of honours, beloved by the light-fingered gentry, reverenced by all the judges on the bench.",
    "He, for all the sacrifices he made to a squint-eyed law, died execrated alike by populace and police.",
    "Already Blueskin had done his worst with a pen-knife; already Jack Sheppard and his comrades had warned Drury Lane against the infamous thief-catcher.",
    "And so anxious, on the other hand, was the law to be quit of their too zealous servant, that an Act of Parliament was passed with the sole object of placing Jonathan's head within the noose.",
    "His method, meagre though masterly, lulled him too soon to an impotent security.",
    "She, with her larger view of life, her plumper sense of style, was content with nothing less than an ultimate sovereignty, and manifestly did she prove her superiority.",
    "Though born for the wimple, she was more of a man than the breeched and stockinged Jonathan, whose only deed of valiance was to hang, terrier-like, by his teeth to an evasive enemy.",
    "While he cheated at cards and cogged the dice, she trained dogs and never missed a bear-baiting.",
    "He shrank, like the coward that he was, from the exercise of manly sports; she cared not what were the weapons-quarterstaff or broadsword-so long as she vanquished her opponent.",
    "She scoured the town in search of insult; he did but exert his cunning when a quarrel was put upon him.",
    "Who, then, shall deny her manhood?",
    "Who shall whisper that his style was the braver or the better suited to his sex?",
    "As became a hero, she kept the best of loose company: her parlour was ever packed with the friends of loyalty and adventure.",
    "Are not Hind and Mull Sack worth a thousand Blueskins?",
    "Moreover, plunder and wealth were not the only objects of her pursuit: she was not merely a fence but a patriot, and she would have accounted a thousand pounds well lost, if she did but compass the discomfiture of a Parliament-man.",
    "Indeed, if Jonathan, the thief-catcher, limped painfully after his magnificent example, Jonathan the man and the sportsman confessed a pitiful inferiority to the valiant Moll.",
    "Thus she avenged her sex by distancing the most illustrious of her rivals; and if he pleads for his credit a taste for theology, hers is the chuckle of contemptuous superiority.",
    "She died a patriot, bequeathing a fountain of wine to the champions of an exiled king; he died a casuist, setting crabbed problems to the Ordinary.",
    "Here, again, the advantage is evident: loyalty is the virtue of men; a sudden attachment to religion is the last resource of the second-rate citizen and of the trapped criminal.",
    "A SPARE, lean frame; a small head set forward upon a pair of sloping shoulders; a thin, sharp nose, and rat-like eyes; a flat, hollow chest; shrunk shanks, modestly retreating from their snuff-coloured hose-these are the tokens which served to remind his friends of Ralph Briscoe, the Clerk of Newgate.",
    "As he left the prison in the grey air of morning upon some errand of mercy or revenge, he appeared the least fearsome of mortals, while an awkward limp upon his left toe deepened the impression of timidity.",
    "So abstract was his manner, so hesitant his gait, that he would hug the wall as he went, nervously stroking its grimy surface with his long, twittering fingers.",
    "But Ralph, as justice and the Jug knew too well, was neither fool nor coward.",
    "His character belied his outward seeming.",
    "A large soul had crept into the case of his wizened body, and if a poltroon among his ancestors had gifted him with an alien type, he had inherited from some nameless warrior both courage and resource.",
    "He was born in easy circumstances, and gently nurtured in the distant village of Kensington.",
    "Though cast in a scholar's mould, and very apt for learning, he rebelled from the outset against a career of inaction.",
    "His lack of strength was never a check upon his high stomach; he would fight with boys of twice his size, and accept the certain defeat in a cheerful spirit of dogged pugnacity.",
    "Moreover, if his arms were weak, his cunning was as keen-edged as his tongue; and, before his stricken eye had paled, he had commonly executed an ample vengeance upon his enemy.",
    "Nor was it industry that placed him at the top of the class.",
    "A ready wit made him master of the knowledge he despised.",
    "But he would always desert his primer to follow the hangman's lumbering cart up Tyburn Hill, and, still a mere imp of mischief, he would run the weary way from Kensington to Shoe Lane on the distant chance of a cock-fight.",
    "He was present, so he would relate in after years, when Sir Thomas Jermin's man put his famous trick upon the pit.",
    "With a hundred pounds in his pocket and under his arm a dunghill cock, neatly trimmed for the fray, the ingenious ruffian, as Briscoe would tell you, went off to Shoe Lane, persuaded an accomplice to fight the cock in Sir Thomas Jermin's name, and laid a level hundred against his own bird.",
    "So lofty was Sir Thomas's repute that backers were easily found, but the dunghill rooster instantly showed a clean pair of heels, and the cheat was justified of his cunning.",
    "Thus Ralph Briscoe learnt the first lessons in that art of sharping wherein he was afterwards an adept; and when he left school his head was packed with many a profitable device which no book learning could impart.",
    "His father, however, still resolute that he should join an intelligent profession, sent him to Gray's Inn that he might study law.",
    "Here the elegance of his handwriting gained him a rapid repute; his skill became the envy of all the lean-souled clerks in the Inn, and he might have died a respectable attorney had not the instinct of sport forced him from the inkpot and parchment of his profession.",
    "Ill could he tolerate the monotony and restraint of this clerkly life.",
    "In his eyes law was an instrument, not of justice, but of jugglery.",
    "Men were born, said his philosophy, rather to risk their necks than ink their fingers; and if a bold adventure puts you in a difficulty, why, then, you hire some straw-splitting attorney to show his cunning.",
    "Indeed, the study of law was for him, as it was for Falstaff, an excuse for many a bout and merry-making.",
    "He loved his glass, and he loved his wench, and he loved a bull-baiting better than either.",
    "It was his boast, and Moll Cutpurse's compliment, that he never missed a match in his life, and assuredly no man was better known in Paris Garden than the intrepid Ralph Briscoe.",
    "The cloistered seclusion of Gray's Inn grew daily more irksome.",
    "There he would sit, in mute despair, drumming the table with his fingers, and biting the quill, whose use he so bitterly contemned.",
    "Of winter afternoons he would stare through the leaded window-panes at the gaunt, leafless trees, on whose summits swayed the cawing rooks, until servitude seemed intolerable, and he prayed for the voice of the bearward that summoned him to Southwark.",
    "And when the chained bear, the familiar monkey on his back, followed the shrill bagpipe along the curious street, Briscoe felt that blood, not ink, coursed in his veins, forgot the tiresome impediment of the law, and joined the throng, hungry for this sport of kings.",
    "Nor was he the patron of an enterprise wherein he dared take no part.",
    "He was as bold and venturesome as the bravest ruffler that ever backed a dog at a baiting.",
    "When the bull, cruelly secured behind, met the onslaught of his opponents, throwing them off, now this side, now that, with his horns, Briscoe, lost in excitement, would leap into the ring that not a point of the combat should escape him.",
    "So it was that he won the friendship of his illustrious benefactress, Moll Cutpurse.",
    "For, one day, when he had ventured too near the maddened bull, the brute made a heave at his breeches, which instantly gave way; and in another moment he would have been gored to death, had not Moll seized him by the collar and slung him out of the ring.",
    "Thus did his courage ever contradict his appearance, and at the dangerous game of whipping the blinded bear he had no rival, either for bravery or adroitness.",
    "He would rush in with uplifted whip until the breath of the infuriated beast was hot upon his cheek, let his angry lash curl for an instant across the bear's flank, and then, for all his halting foot, leap back into safety with a smiling pride in his own nimbleness.",
    "His acquaintance with Moll Cutpurse, casually begun at a bull-baiting, speedily ripened, for her into friendship, for him into love.",
    "In this, the solitary romance of his life, Ralph Briscoe overtopped even his own achievements of courage.",
    "The Roaring Girl was no more young, and years had not refined her character unto gentleness.",
    "It was still her habit to appear publicly in jerkin and galligaskins, to smoke tobacco in contempt of her sex, and to fight her enemies with a very fury of insolence.",
    "In stature she exceeded the limping clerk by a head, and she could pick him up with one hand, like a kitten.",
    "Yet he loved her, not for any grace of person, nor beauty of feature, nor even because her temperament was undaunted as his own.",
    "He loved her for that wisest of reasons, which is no reason at all, because he loved her.",
    "In his eyes she was the Queen, not of Misrule, but of Hearts.",
    "Had a throne been his, she should have shared it, and he wooed her with a shy intensity, which ennobled him, even in her austere regard.",
    "Alas!",
    "she was unable to return his passion, and she lamented her own obduracy with characteristic humour.",
    "She made no attempt to conceal her admiration.",
    "'A notable and famous person,' she called him, confessing that, 'he was right for her tooth, and made to her mind in every part of him.'",
    "He had been bred up in the same exercise of bull-baiting, which was her own delight; she had always praised his towardliness, and prophesied his preferment.",
    "But when he paid her court she was obliged to decline the honour, while she esteemed the compliment.",
    "In truth, she was completely insensible to passion, or, as she exclaimed in a phrase of brilliant independence, 'I should have hired him to my embraces.'",
    "The sole possibility that remained was a Platonic friendship, and Briscoe accepted the situation in excellent humour.",
    "'Ever since he came to know himself,' again it is Moll that speaks, 'he always deported himself to me with an abundance of regard, calling me his Aunt.'",
    "And his aunt she remained unto the end, bound to him in a proper and natural alliance.",
    "Different as they were in aspect, they were strangely alike in taste and disposition.",
    "Nor was the Paris Garden their only meeting-ground.",
    "His sorry sojourn in Gray's Inn had thrown him on the side of the law-breaker, and he had acquired a strange cunning in the difficult art of evading justice.",
    "Instantly Moll recognised his practical value, and, exerting all her talent for intrigue, presently secured for him the Clerkship of Newgate.",
    "Here at last he found scope not only for his learning, but for that spirit of adventure that breathed within him.",
    "His meagre acquaintance with letters placed him on a pinnacle high above his colleagues.",
    "Now and then a prisoner proved his equal in wit, but as he was manifestly superior in intelligence to the Governor, the Ordinary, and all the warders, he speedily seized and hereafter retained the real sovereignty of Newgate.",
    "His early progress was barred by envy and contempt.",
    "Why, asked the men in possession, should this shrivelled stranger filch our privileges?",
    "And Briscoe met their malice with an easy smile, knowing that at all points he was more than their match.",
    "His alliance with Moll stood him in good stead, and in a few months the twain were the supreme arbiters of English justice.",
    "Should a highwayman seek to save his neck, he must first pay a fat indemnity to the Newgate Clerk, but, since Moll was the appointed banker of the whole family, she was quick to sanction whatever price her accomplice suggested.",
    "And Briscoe had a hundred other tricks whereby he increased his riches and repute.",
    "There was no debtor came to Newgate whom the Clerk would not aid, if he believed the kindness profitable.",
    "Suppose his inquiries gave an assurance of his victim's recovery, he would house him comfortably, feed him at his own table, lend him money, and even condescend to win back the generous loan by the dice-box.",
    "His civility gave him a general popularity among the prisoners, and his appearance in the Yard was a signal for a subdued hilarity.",
    "He drank and gambled with the roysterers; he babbled a cheap philosophy with the erudite; and he sold the necks of all to the highest bidder.",
    "Though now and again he was convicted of mercy or revenge, he commonly held himself aloof from human passions, and pursued the one sane end of life in an easy security.",
    "The hostility of his colleagues irked him but little.",
    "A few tags of Latin, the friendship of Moll, and a casual threat of exposure frightened the Governor into acquiescence, but the Ordinary was more difficult of conciliation.",
    "The Clerk had not been long in Newgate before he saw that between the reverend gentleman and himself there could be naught save war.",
    "Hitherto the Ordinary had reserved to his own profit the right of intrigue; he it was who had received the hard-scraped money of the sorrowing relatives, and untied the noose when it seemed good to him.",
    "Briscoe insisted upon a division of labour.",
    "'It is your business,' he said, 'to save the scoundrels in the other world.",
    "Leave to me the profit of their salvation in this.'",
    "And the Clerk triumphed after his wont: freedom jingled in his pocket; he doled out comfort, even life, to the oppressed; and he extorted a comfortable fortune in return for privileges which were never in his gift.",
    "Without the walls of Newgate the house of his frequentation was the 'Dog Tavern.'",
    "Thither he would wander every afternoon to meet his clients and to extort blood-money.",
    "In this haunt of criminals and pettifoggers no man was better received than the Newgate Clerk, and while he assumed a manner of generous cordiality, it was a strange sight to see him wince when some sturdy ruffian slapped him too strenuously upon the back.",
    "He had a joke and a chuckle for all, and his merry quips, dry as they were, were joyously quoted to all new-comers.",
    "His legal ingenuity appeared miraculous, and it was confidently asserted in the Coffee House that he could turn black to white with so persuasive an argument that there was no Judge on the Bench to confute him.",
    "But he was not omnipotent, and his zeal encountered many a serious check.",
    "At times he failed to save the necks even of his intimates, since, when once a ruffian was notorious, Moll and the Clerk fought vainly for his release.",
    "Thus it was that Cheney, the famous wrestler, whom Ralph had often backed against all comers, died at Tyburn.",
    "He had been taken by the troopers red-handed upon the highway.",
    "Seized after a desperate resistance, he was wounded wellnigh to death, and Briscoe quoted a dozen precedents to prove that he was unfit to be tried or hanged.",
    "Argument failing, the munificent Clerk offered fifty pounds for the life of his friend.",
    "But to no purpose: the valiant wrestler was carried to the cart in a chair, and so lifted to the gallows, which cured him of his gaping wounds.",
    "When the Commonwealth administered justice with pedantic severity, Briscoe's influence still further declined.",
    "There was no longer scope in the State for men of spirit; even the gaols were handed over to the stern mercy of crop-eared Puritans; Moll herself had fallen upon evil times; and Ralph Briscoe determined to make a last effort for wealth and retirement.",
    "At the very moment when his expulsion seemed certain, an heiress was thrown into Newgate upon a charge of murdering a too importunate suitor.",
    "The chain of evidence was complete: the dagger plunged in his heart was recognised for her own; she was seen to decoy him to the secret corner of a wood, where his raucous love-making was silenced for ever.",
    "Taken off her guard, she had even hinted confession of her crime, and nothing but intrigue could have saved her gentle neck from the gallows.",
    "Briscoe, hungry for her money-bags, promised assistance.",
    "He bribed, he threatened, he cajoled, he twisted the law as only he could twist it, he suppressed honest testimony, he procured false; in fine, he weakened the case against her with so resistless an effrontery, that not the Hanging Judge himself could convict the poor innocent.",
    "At the outset he had agreed to accept a handsome bribe, but as the trial approached, his avarice increased, and he would be content with nothing less than the lady's hand and fortune.",
    "Not that he loved her; his heart was long since given to Moll Cutpurse; but he knew that his career of depredation was at an end, and it became him to provide for his declining years.",
    "The victim repulsed his suit, regretting a thousand times that she had stabbed her ancient lover.",
    "At last, bidden summarily to choose between Death and the Clerk, she chose the Clerk, and thus Ralph Briscoe left Newgate the richest squire in a western county.",
    "Henceforth he farmed his land like a gentleman, drank with those of his neighbours who would crack a bottle with him, and unlocked the strange stores of his memory to bumpkins who knew not the name of Newgate.",
    "Still devoted to sport, he hunted the fox, and made such a bull-ring as his youthful imagination could never have pictured.",
    "So he lived a life of country ease, and died a churchwarden.",
    "And he deserved his prosperity, for he carried the soul of Falstaff in the shrunken body of Justice Shallow.",
    "HE stood six feet ten in his stockinged feet, and was the tallest ruffian that ever cut a purse or held up a coach on the highway.",
    "A mass of black hair curled over a low forehead, and a glittering eye intensified his villainous aspect; nor did a deep scar, furrowing his cheek from end to end, soften the horror of his sudden apparition.",
    "Valiant men shuddered at his approach; women shrank from the distant echo of his name; for fifteen years he terrorised Scotland from Caithness to the border; and the most partial chronicler never insulted his memory with the record of a good deed.",
    "He was born to a gentle family in the Calendar of Monteith, and was celebrated even in boyhood for his feats of strength and daring.",
    "While still at school he could hold a hundredweight at arm's-length, and crumple up a horseshoe like a wisp of hay.",
    "The fleetest runner, the most desperate fighter in the country, he was already famous before his name was besmirched with crime, and he might have been immortalised as the Hercules of the seventeenth century, had not his ambition been otherwise flattered.",
    "At the outset, though the inclination was never lacking, he knew small temptation to break the sterner laws of conduct.",
    "His pleasures were abundantly supplied by his father's generosity, and he had no need to refrain from such vices as became a gentleman.",
    "If he was no drunkard, it was because his head was equal to the severest strain, and, despite his forbidding expression, he was always a successful breaker of hearts.",
    "His very masterfulness overcame the most stubborn resistance; and more than once the pressure of his dishonourable suit converted hatred into love.",
    "At the very time that he was denounced for Scotland's disgrace, his praises were chanted in many a dejected ballad.",
    "'Gilderoy was a bonny boy,' sang one heart-broken maiden:                           Had roses till his shoon,  His stockings were of silken soy,  Wi' garters hanging doon.",
    "But in truth he was admired less for his amiability than for that quality of governance which, when once he had torn the decalogue to pieces, made him a veritable emperor of crime.",
    "His father's death was the true beginning of his career.",
    "A modest patrimony was squandered in six months, and Gilderoy had no penny left wherewith to satisfy the vices which insisted upon indulgence.",
    "He demanded money at all hazards, and money without toil.",
    "For a while his more loudly clamant needs were fulfilled by the amiable simplicity of his mother, whom he blackmailed with insolence and contempt.",
    "And when she, wearied by his shameless importunity, at last withdrew her support, he determined upon a monstrous act of vengeance.",
    "With a noble affectation of penitence he visited his home; promised reform at supper; and said good-night in the broken accent of reconciliation.",
    "No sooner was the house sunk in slumber than he crawled stealthily upstairs in order to forestall by theft a promised generosity.",
    "He opened the door of the bed-chamber in a hushed silence; but the wrenching of the cofferlid awoke the sleeper, and Gilderoy, having cut his mother's throat with an infamous levity, seized whatever money and jewels were in the house, cruelly maltreated his sister, and laughingly burnt the house to the ground, that the possibility of evidence might be destroyed.",
    "Henceforth his method of plunder was assured.",
    "It was part of his philosophy to prevent detection by murder, and the flames from the burning walls added a pleasure to his lustful eye.",
    "His march across Scotland was marked by slaughtered families and ruined houses.",
    "Plunder was the first cause of his exploits, but there is no doubt that death and arson were a solace to his fierce spirit; and for a while this giant of cruelty knew neither check nor hindrance.",
    "Presently it became a superstition with him that death was the inevitable accompaniment of robbery, and, as he was incapable of remorse, he grew callous, and neglected the simplest precautions.",
    "At Dunkeld he razed a rifled house to the ground, and with the utmost effrontery repeated the performance at Aberdeen.",
    "But at last he had been tracked by a company of soldiers, who, that justice might not be cheated of her prey, carried him to gaol, where after the briefest trial he was condemned to death.",
    "Gilderoy, however, was still master of himself.",
    "His immense strength not only burst his bonds, but broke prison, and this invincible Samson was once more free in Aberdeen, inspiring that respectable city with a legendary dread.",
    "The reward of one hundred pounds was offered in vain.",
    "Had he shown himself on the road in broad daylight, none would have dared to arrest him, and it was not until his plans were deliberately laid, that he crossed the sea.",
    "The more violent period of his career was at an end.",
    "Never again did he yield to his passion for burning and sudden death; and, if the world found him unconquerable, his self-control is proved by the fact that in the heyday of his strength he turned from his unredeemed brutality to a gentler method.",
    "He now deserted Scotland for France, with which, like all his countrymen, he claimed a cousinship; and so profoundly did he impose upon Paris with his immense stature, his elegant attire, his courtly manners (for he was courtesy itself, when it pleased him), that he was taken for an eminent scholar, or at least a soldier of fortune.",
    "Prosperity might doubtless have followed a discreet profession, but Gilderoy must still be thieving, and he reaped a rich harvest among the unsuspicious courtiers of France.",
    "His most highly renowned exploit was performed at St. Denis, and the record of France's humiliation is still treasured.",
    "The great church was packed with ladies of fashion and their devout admirers.",
    "Richelieu attended in state; the king himself shone upon the assembly.",
    "The strange Scotsman, whom no man knew and all men wondered at, attracted a hundred eyes to himself and his magnificent equipment.",
    "But it was not his to be idle, and at the very moment whereat Mass was being sung, he contrived to lighten Richelieu's pocket of a purse.",
    "The king was a delighted witness of the theft; Gilderoy, assuming an air of facile intimacy, motioned him to silence; and he, deeming it a trick put upon Richelieu by a friend, hastened, at the service-end, to ask his minister if perchance he had a purse of gold upon him.",
    "Richelieu instantly discovered the loss, to the king's uncontrolled hilarity, which was mitigated when it was found that the thief, having emptied the king's pocket at the unguarded moment of his merriment, had left them both the poorer.",
    "Such were Gilderoy's interludes of gaiety; and when you remember the cynical ferocity of his earlier performance, you cannot deny him the credit of versatility.",
    "He stayed in France until his ominous reputation was too widely spread; whereupon he crossed the Pyrenees, travelling like a gentleman, in a brilliant carriage of his own.",
    "From Spain he carried off a priceless collection of silver plate; and he returned to his own country, fatigued, yet unsoftened, by the grand tour.",
    "Meanwhile, a forgetful generation had not kept his memory green.",
    "The monster, who punished Scotland a year ago with fire and sword, had passed into oblivion, and Gilderoy was able to establish for himself a new reputation.",
    "He departed as far as possible from his ancient custom, joined the many cavaliers, who were riding up and down the country, pistol in hand, and presently proved a dauntless highwayman.",
    "He had not long ridden in the neighbourhood of Perth before he met the Earl of Linlithgow, from whom he took a gold watch, a diamond ring, and eighty guineas.",
    "Being an outlaw, he naturally espoused the King's cause, and would have given a year of his life to meet a Regicide.",
    "Once upon a time, says rumour, he found himself face to face with Oliver Cromwell, whom he dragged from his coach, set ignominiously upon an ass, and so turned adrift with his feet tied under the beast's belly.",
    "The story is incredible, not only because the loyal historians of the time caused Oliver to be robbed daily on every road in Great Britain, but because our Gilderoy, had he ever confronted the Protector, most assuredly would not have allowed him to escape with his life.",
    "Tired of scouring the highway, Gilderoy resolved upon another enterprise.",
    "He collected a band of fearless ruffians, and placed himself at their head.",
    "With this army to aid, he harried Sutherland and the North, lifting cattle, plundering homesteads, and stopping wayfarers with a humour and adroitness worthy of Robin Hood.",
    "No longer a lawless adventurer, he made his own conditions of life, and forced the people to obey them.",
    "He who would pay Gilderoy a fair contribution ran no risk of losing his sheep or oxen.",
    "But evasion was impossible, and the smallest suspicion of falsehood was punished by death.",
    "The peaceably inclined paid their toll with regret; the more daring opposed the raider to their miserable undoing; the timid satisfied the utmost exactions of Gilderoy, and deemed themselves fortunate if they left the country with their lives.",
    "Thus Scotland became a land of dread; the most restless man within her borders hardly dare travel beyond his byre.",
    "The law was powerless against this indomitable scourge, and the reward of a thousand marks would have been offered in vain, had not Gilderoy's cruelty estranged his mistress.",
    "This traitress-Peg Cunningham was her name-less for avarice than in revenge for many insults and infidelities, at last betrayed her master.",
    "Having decoyed him to her house, she admitted fifty armed men, and thus imagined a full atonement for her unnumbered wrongs.",
    "But Gilderoy was triumphant to the last.",
    "Instantly suspecting the treachery of his mistress, he burst into her bed-chamber, and, that she might not enjoy the price of blood, ripped her up with a hanger.",
    "Then he turned defiant upon the army arrayed against him, and killed eight men before the others captured him.",
    "Disarmed after a desperate struggle, he was loaded with chains and carried to Edinburgh, where he was starved for three days, and then hanged without the formality of a trial on a gibbet, thirty feet high, set up in the Grassmarket.",
    "Even then Scotland's vengeance was unsatisfied.",
    "The body, cut down from its first gibbet, was hung in chains forty feet above Leith Walk, where it creaked and gibbered as a warning to evildoers for half a century, until at last the inhabitants of that respectable quarter petitioned that Gilderoy's bones should cease to rattle, and that they should enjoy the peace impossible for his jingling skeleton.",
    "Gilderoy was no drawing-room scoundrel, no villain of schoolgirl romance.",
    "He felt remorse as little as he felt fear, and there was no crime from whose commission he shrank.",
    "Before his death he confessed to thirty-seven murders, and bragged that he had long since lost count of his robberies and rapes.",
    "Something must be abated for boastfulness.",
    "But after all deduction there remains a tale of crime that is unsurpassed.",
    "His most admirably artistic quality is his complete consistence.",
    "He was a ruffian finished and rotund; he made no concession, he betrayed no weakness.",
    "Though he never preached a sermon against the human race, he practised a brutality which might have proceeded from a gospel of hate.",
    "He spared neither friends nor relatives, and he murdered his own mother with as light a heart as he sent a strange widow of Aberdeen to her death.",
    "His skill is undoubted, and he proved by the discipline of his band that he was not without some talent of generalship.",
    "But he owed much of his success to his physical strength, and to the temperament, which never knew the scandal of hesitancy or dread.",
    "A born marauder, he devoted his life to his trade; and, despite his travels in France and Spain, he enjoyed few intervals of merriment.",
    "Even the humour, which proved his redemption, was as dour and grim as Scotland can furnish at her grimmes: and dourest.",
    "Here is a specimen will serve as well as another: three of Gilderoy's gang had been hanged according to the sentence of a certain Lord of Session, and the Chieftain, for his own vengeance and the intimidation of justice, resolved upon an exemplary punishment.",
    "He waylaid the Lord of Session, emptied his pockets, killed his horses, broke his coach in pieces, and having bound his lackeys, drowned them in a pond.",
    "This was but the prelude of revenge, for presently (and here is the touch of humour) he made the Lord of Session ride at dead of night to the gallows, whereon the three malefactors were hanging.",
    "One arm of the crossbeams was still untenanted.",
    "'By my soul, mon,' cried Gilderoy to the Lord of Session, 'as this gibbet is built to break people's craigs, and is not uniform without another, I must e'en hang you upon the vacant beam.'",
    "And straightway the Lord of Session swung in the moonlight, and Gilderoy had cracked his black and solemn joke.",
    "This sense of fun is the single trait which relieves the colossal turpitude of Gilderoy.",
    "And, though even his turpitude was melodramatic in its lack of balance, it is a unity of character which is the foundation of his greatness.",
    "He was no fumbler, led away from his purpose by the first diversion; his ambition was clear before him, and he never fell below it.",
    "He defied Scotland for fifteen years, was hanged so high that he passed into a proverb, and though his handsome, sinister face might have made women his slaves, he was never betrayed by passion (or by virtue) to an amiability.",
    "THE 'Green Pig' stood in the solitude of the North Road.",
    "Its simple front, its neatly balanced windows, curtained with white, gave it an air of comfort and tranquillity.",
    "The smoke which curled from its hospitable chimney spoke of warmth and good fare.",
    "To pass it was to spurn the last chance of a bottle for many a weary mile, and the prudent traveller would always rest an hour by its ample fireside, or gossip with its fantastic hostess.",
    "Now, the hostess of the little inn was Ellen Roach, friend and accomplice of Sixteen-String Jack, once the most famous woman in England, and still after a weary stretch at Botany Bay the strangest of companions, the most buxom of spinsters.",
    "Her beauty was elusive even in her triumphant youth, and middle-age had neither softened her traits nor refined her expression.",
    "Her auburn hair, once the glory of Covent Garden, was fading to a withered grey; she was never tall enough to endure an encroaching stoutness with equanimity; her dumpy figure made you marvel at her past success; and hardship had furrowed her candid brow into wrinkles.",
    "But when she opened her lips she became instantly animated.",
    "With a glass before her on the table, she would prattle frankly and engagingly of the past.",
    "Strange cities had she seen; she had faced the dangers of an adventurous life with calmness and good temper.",
    "And yet Botany Bay, with its attendant horrors, was already fading from her memory.",
    "In imagination she was still with her incomparable hero, and it was her solace, after fifteen years, to sing the praise and echo the perfections of Sixteen-String Jack.",
    "'How well I remember,' she would murmur, as though unconscious of her audience, 'the unhappy day when Jack Rann was first arrested.",
    "It was May, and he came back travel-stained and weary in the brilliant dawn.",
    "He had stopped a one-horse shay near the nine-mile stone on the Hounslow Road-every word of his confession is burnt into my brain-and had taken a watch and a handful of guineas.",
    "I was glad enough of the money, for there was no penny in the house, and presently I sent the maid-servant to make the best bargain she could with the watch.",
    "But the silly jade, by the saddest of mishaps, took the trinket straight to the very man who made it, and he, suspecting a theft, had us both arrested.",
    "Even then Jack might have been safe, had not the devil prompted me to speak the truth.",
    "Dismayed by the magistrate, I owned, wretched woman that I was, that I had received the watch from Rann, and in two hours Jack also was under lock and key.",
    "Yet, when we were sent for trial I made what amends I could.",
    "I declared on oath that I had never seen Sixteen-String Jack in my life; his name came to my lips by accident; and, hector as they would, the lawyers could not frighten me to an acknowledgment.",
    "Meanwhile Jack's own behaviour was grand.",
    "I was the proudest woman in England as I stood by his side in the dock.",
    "When you compared him with Sir John Fielding, you did not doubt for an instant which was the finer gentleman.",
    "And what a dandy was my Jack!",
    "Though he came there to answer for his life, he was all ribbons and furbelows.",
    "His irons were tied up with the daintiest blue bows, and in the breast of his coat he carried a bundle of flowers as large as a birch-broom.",
    "His neck quivered in the noose, yet he was never cowed to civility.",
    "'I know no more of the matter than you do,' he cried indignantly, 'nor half so much neither,' and if the magistrate had not been an ill-mannered oaf, he would not have dared to disbelieve my true-hearted Jack.",
    "That time we escaped with whole skins; and off we went, after dinner, to Vauxhall, where Jack was more noticed than the fiercest of the bloods, and where he filled the heart of George Barrington with envy.",
    "Nor was he idle, despite his recent escape: he brought away two watches and three purses from the Garden, so that our necessities were amply supplied.",
    "Ah, I should have been happy in those days if only Jack had been faithful.",
    "But he had a roving eye and a joyous temperament; and though he loved me better than any of the baggages to whom he paid court, he would not visit me so often as he should.",
    "Why, once he was hustled off to Bow Street because the watch caught him climbing in at Doll Frampton's window.",
    "And she, the shameless minx, got him off by declaring in open court that she would be proud to receive him whenever he would deign to ring at her bell.",
    "That is the penalty of loving a great man: you must needs share his affection with a set of unworthy wenches.",
    "Yet Jack was always kind to me, and I was the chosen companion of his pranks.",
    "'Never can I forget the splendid figure he cut that day at Bagnigge Wells.",
    "We had driven down in our coach, and all the world marvelled at our magnificence.",
    "Jack was brave in a scarlet coat, a tambour waistcoat, and white silk stockings.",
    "From the knees of his breeches streamed the strings (eight at each), whence he got his name, and as he plucked off his lace-hat the dinner-table rose at him.",
    "That was a moment worth living for, and when, after his first bottle, Jack rattled the glasses, and declared himself a highwayman, the whole company shuddered.",
    "\"But, my friends,\" quoth he, \"to-day I am making holiday, so that you have naught to fear.\"",
    "When the wine 's in, the wit 's out, and Jack could never stay his hand from the bottle.",
    "The more he drank, the more he bragged, until, thoroughly fuddled, he lost a ring from his finger, and charged the miscreants in the room with stealing it.",
    "\"However,\" hiccupped he, \"'tis a mere nothing, worth a paltry hundred pounds-less than a lazy evening's work.",
    "So I'll let the trifling theft pass.\"",
    "But the cowards were not content with Jack's generosity, and seizing upon him, they thrust him neck and crop through the window.",
    "They were seventeen to one, the craven-hearted loons; and I could but leave the marks of my nails on the cheek of the foremost, and follow my hero into the yard, where we took coach, and drove sulkily back to Covent Garden.",
    "'And yet he was not always in a mad humour; in fact, Sixteen-String Jack, for all his gaiety, was a proud, melancholy man.",
    "The shadow of the tree was always upon him, and he would make me miserable by talking of his certain doom.",
    "\"I have a hundred pounds in my pocket,\" he would say; \"I shall spend that, and then I shan't last long.\"",
    "And though I never thought him serious, his prophecy came true enough.",
    "Only a few months before the end we had visited Tyburn together.",
    "With his usual carelessness, he passed the line of constables who were on guard.",
    "\"It is very proper,\" said he, in his jauntiest tone, \"that I should be a spectator on this melancholy occasion.\"",
    "And though none of the dullards took his jest, they instantly made way for him.",
    "For my Jack was always a gentleman, though he was bred to the stable, and his bitterest enemy could not have denied that he was handsome.",
    "His open countenance was as honest as the day, and the brown curls over his forehead were more elegant than the smartest wig.",
    "Wherever he went the world did him honour, and many a time my vanity was sorely wounded.",
    "I was a pretty girl, mind you, though my travels have not improved my beauty; and I had many admirers before ever I picked up Jack Rann at a masquerade.",
    "Why, there was a Templar, with two thousand a year, who gave me a carriage and servants while I still lived at the dressmaker's in Oxford Street, and I was not out of my teens when the old Jew in St. Mary Axe took me into keeping.",
    "But when Jack was by, I had no chance of admiration.",
    "All the eyes were glued upon him, and his poor doxy had to be content with a furtive look thrown over a stranger's shoulder.",
    "At Barnet races, the year before they sent me across the sea, we were followed by a crowd the livelong day; and truly Jack, in his blue satin waistcoat laced with silver, might have been a peer.",
    "At any rate, he had not his equal on the course, and it is small wonder that never for a moment were we left to ourselves.",
    "'But happiness does not last for ever; only too often we were gravelled for lack of money, and Jack, finding his purse empty, could do naught else than hire a hackney and take to the road again, while I used to lie awake listening to the watchman's raucous voice, and praying God to send back my warrior rich and scatheless.",
    "So times grew more and more difficult.",
    "Jack would stay a whole night upon the heath, and come home with an empty pocket or a beggarly half crown.",
    "And there was nothing, after a shabby coat that he hated half so much as a sheriff's officer.",
    "\"Learn a lesson in politeness,\" he said to one of the wretches who dragged him off to the Marshalsea.",
    "\"When Sir John Fielding's people come after me they use me genteelly; they only hold up a finger, beckon me, and I follow as quietly as a lamb.",
    "But you bluster and insult, as though you had never dealings with gentlemen.\"",
    "Poor Jack, he was of a proud stomach, and could not abide interference; yet they would never let him go free.",
    "And he would have been so happy had he been allowed his own way.",
    "To pull out a rusty pistol now and again, and to take a purse from a traveller-surely these were innocent pleasures, and he never meant to hurt a fellow-creature.",
    "But for all his kindness of heart, for all his love of splendour and fine clothes, they took him at last.",
    "'And this time, too, it was a watch which was our ruin.",
    "How often did I warn him: \"Jack,\" I would say, \"take all the money you can.",
    "Guineas tell no tale.",
    "But leave the watches in their owners' fobs.\"",
    "Alas!",
    "he did not heed my words, and the last man he ever stopped on the road was that pompous rascal, Dr. Bell, then chaplain to the Princess Amelia.",
    "\"Give me your money,\" screamed Jack, \"and take no notice or I'll blow your brains out.\"",
    "And the doctor gave him all that he had, the mean-spirited devil-dodger, and it was no more than eighteenpence.",
    "Now what should a man of courage do with eighteenpence?",
    "So poor Jack was forced to seize the parson's watch and trinkets as well, and thus it was that a second time we faced the Blind Beak.",
    "When Jack brought home the watch, I was seized with a shuddering presentiment, and I would have given the world to throw it out of the window.",
    "But I could not bear to see him pinched with hunger, and he had already tossed the doctor's eighteenpence to a beggar woman.",
    "So I trudged off to the pawnbroker's, to get what price I could, and I bethought me that none would know me for what I was so far away as Oxford Street.",
    "But the monster behind the counter had a quick suspicion, though I swear I looked as innocent as a babe; he discovered the owner of the watch, and infamously followed me to my house.",
    "'The next day we were both arrested, and once more we stood in the hot, stifling Court of the Old Bailey.",
    "Jack was radiant as ever, the one spot of colour and gaiety in that close, sodden atmosphere.",
    "When we were taken from Bow Street a thousand people formed our guard of honour, and for a month we were the twin wonders of London.",
    "The lightest word, the fleetest smile of the renowned highwayman, threw the world into a fit of excitement, and a glimpse of Rann was worth a king's ransom.",
    "I could look upon him all day for nothing!",
    "And I knew what a fever of fear throbbed behind his mask of happy contempt.",
    "Yet bravely he played the part unto the very end.",
    "If the toasts of London were determined to gaze at him, he assured them they should have a proper salve for their eyes.",
    "So he dressed himself as a light-hearted sportsman.",
    "His coat and waistcoat were of pea-green cloth; his buckskin breeches were spotlessly new, and all tricked out with the famous strings; his hat was bound round with silver cords; and even the ushers of the Court were touched to courtesy.",
    "He would whisper to me, as we stood in the dock, \"Cheer up, my girl.",
    "I have ordered the best supper that Covent Garden can provide, and we will make merry to-night when this foolish old judge has done his duty.\"",
    "The supper was never eaten.",
    "Through the weary afternoon we waited for acquittal.",
    "The autumn sun sank in hopeless gloom.",
    "The wretched lamps twinkled through the jaded air of the court-house.",
    "In an hour I lived a thousand years of misery, and when the sentence was read, the words carried no sense to my withered brain.",
    "It was only in my cell I realised that I had seen Jack Rann for the last time; that his pea-green coat would prove a final and ineffaceable memory.",
    "'Alas!",
    "I, who had never been married, was already a hempen widow; but I was too hopelessly heartbroken for my lover's fate to think of my own paltry hardship.",
    "I never saw him again.",
    "They told me that he suffered at Tyburn like a man, and that he counted upon a rescue to the very end.",
    "They told me (still bitterer news to hear) that two days before his death he entertained seven women at supper, and was in the wildest humour.",
    "This almost broke my heart; it was an infidelity committed on the other side of the grave.",
    "But, poor Jack, he was a good lad, and loved me more than them all, though he never could be faithful to me.'",
    "And thus, bidding the drawer bring fresh glasses, Ellen Roach would end her story.",
    "Though she had told it a hundred times, at the last words a tear always sparkled in her eye.",
    "She lived without friend and without lover, faithful to the memory of Sixteen-String Jack, who for her was the only reality in the world of shades.",
    "Her middle-age was as distant as her youth.",
    "The dressmaker's in Oxford Street was as vague a dream as the inhospitable shore of Botany Bay.",
    "So she waited on to a weary eld, proud of the 'Green Pig's' well-ordered comfort, prouder still that for two years she shared the glory of Jack Rann, and that she did not desert her hero, even in his punishment.",
    "THEIR closest parallel is the notoriety which dogged them from the very day of their death.",
    "Each, for his own exploits, was the most famous man of his time, the favourite of broadsides, the prime hero of the ballad-mongers.",
    "And each owed his fame as much to good fortune as to merit, since both were excelled in their generation by more skilful scoundrels.",
    "If Gilderoy was unsurpassed in brutality, he fell immeasurably below Hind in artistry and wit, nor may he be compared to such accomplished highwaymen as Mull Sack or the Golden Farmer.",
    "His method was not elevated by a touch of the grand style.",
    "He stamped all the rules of the road beneath his contemptuous foot, and cared not what enormity he committed in his quest for gold.",
    "Yet, though he lived in the true Augustan age, he yielded to no one of his rivals in glorious recognition.",
    "So, too, Jack Rann, of the Sixteen Strings, was a near contemporary of George Barrington.",
    "While that nimble-fingered prig was making a brilliant appearance at Vauxhall, and emptying the pockets of his intimates, Rann was riding over Hounslow Heath, and flashing his pistol in the eye of the wayfarer.",
    "The very year in which Jack danced his last jig at Tyburn, Barrington had astonished London by a fruitless attempt to steal Prince Orloff's miraculous snuff-box.",
    "And not even Ellen Roach herself would have dared to assert that Rann was Barrington's equal in sleight of hand.",
    "But Rann holds his own against the best of his craft, with an imperishable name, while a host of more distinguished cracksmen are excluded even from the Newgate Calendar.",
    "In truth, there is one quality which has naught to do with artistic supremacy; and in this quality both Rann and Gilderoy were rich beyond their fellows.",
    "They knew (none better) how to impose upon the world.",
    "Had their deserts been even less than they were, they would still have been bravely notorious.",
    "It is a common superstition that the talent for advertisement has but a transitory effect, that time sets all men in their proper places.",
    "Nothing can be more false; for he who has once declared himself among the great ones of the earth, not only holds his position while he lives, but forces an unreasoning admiration upon the future.",
    "Though he declines from the lofty throne, whereon his own vanity and love of praise have set him, he still stands above the modest level which contents the genuinely great.",
    "Why does Euripides still throw a shadow upon the worthier poets of his time?",
    "Because he had the faculty of displacement, because he could compel the world to profess an interest not only in his work but in himself.",
    "Why is Michael Angelo a loftier figure in the history of art than Donatello, the supreme sculptor of his time?",
    "Because Donatello had not the temper which would bully a hundred popes, and extract a magnificent advertisement from each encounter.",
    "Why does Shelley still claim a larger share of the world's admiration than Keats, his indubitable superior?",
    "Because Shelley was blessed or cursed with the trick of interesting the world by the accidents of his life.",
    "So by a similar faculty Gilderoy and Jack Rann have kept themselves and their achievements in the light of day.",
    "Had they lived in the nineteenth century they might have been the vendors of patent pills, or the chairmen of bubble companies.",
    "Whatever trade they had followed, their names would have been on every hoarding, their wares would have been puffed in every journal.",
    "They understood the art of publicity better than any of their contemporaries, and they are remembered not because they were the best thieves of their time, but because they were determined to interest the people in their misdeeds.",
    "Gilderoy's brutality, which was always theatrical, ensured a constant remembrance, and the lofty gallows added to his repute; while the brilliant inspiration of the strings, which decorated Rann's breeches, was sufficient to conquer death.",
    "How should a hero sink to oblivion who had chosen for himself so splendid a name as Sixteen-String Jack?",
    "So far, then, their achievement is parallel.",
    "And parallel also is their taste for melodrama.",
    "Each employed means too great or too violent for the end in view.",
    "Gilderoy burnt houses and ravished women, when his sole object was the acquisition of money.",
    "Sixteen-String Jack terrified Bagnigge Wells with the dreadful announcement that he was a highwayman, when his kindly, stupid heart would have shrunk from the shedding of a drop of blood.",
    "So they both blustered through the world, the one in deed, the other in word; and both played their parts with so little refinement that they frightened the groundlings to a timid admiration.",
    "Here the resemblance is at an end.",
    "In the essentials of their trade Gilderoy was a professional, Rann a mere amateur.",
    "They both bullied; but, while Sixteen-String Jack was content to shout threats, and pick up half-a-crown, Gilderoy breathed murder, and demanded a vast ransom.",
    "Only once in his career did the 'disgraceful Scotsman' become gay and debonair.",
    "Only once did he relax the tension of his frown, and pick pockets with the lightness and freedom of a gentleman.",
    "It was on his voyage to France that he forgot his old policy of arson and pillage, and truly the Court of the Great King was not the place for his rapacious cruelty.",
    "Jack Rann, on the other hand, would have taken life as a prolonged jest, if Sir John Fielding and the sheriffs had not checked his mirth.",
    "He was but a bungler on the road, with no more resource than he might have learned from the common chap-book, or from the dying speeches, hawked in Newgate Street.",
    "But he had a fine talent for merriment; he loved nothing so well as a smart coat and a pretty woman.",
    "Thieving was no passion with him, but a necessity.",
    "How could he dance at a masquerade or court his Ellen with an empty pocket?",
    "So he took to the road as the sole profession of an idle man, and he bullied his way from Hounslow to Epping in sheer lightness of heart.",
    "After all, to rob Dr. Bell of eighteenpence was the work of a simpleton.",
    "It was a very pretty taste which expressed itself in a pea-green coat and deathless strings; and Rann will keep posterity's respect rather for the accessories of his art than for the art itself.",
    "On the other hand, you cannot imagine Gilderoy habited otherwise than in black; you cannot imagine this monstrous matricide taking pleasure in the smaller elegancies of life.",
    "From first to last he was the stern and beetle-browed marauder, who would have despised the frippery of Sixteen-String Jack as vehemently as his sudden appearance would have frightened the foppish lover of Ellen Roach.",
    "Their conduct with women is sufficient index of their character.",
    "Jack Rann was too general a lover for fidelity.",
    "But he was amiable, even in his unfaithfulness; he won the undying affection of his Ellen; he never stood in the dock without a nosegay tied up by fair and nimble fingers; he was attended to Tyburn by a bevy of distinguished admirers.",
    "Gilderoy, on the other hand, approached women in a spirit of violence.",
    "His Sadic temper drove him to kill those whom he affected to love.",
    "And his cruelty was amply repaid.",
    "While Ellen Roach perjured herself to save the lover, to whose memory she professed a lifelong loyalty, it was Peg Cunningham who wreaked her vengeance in the betrayal of Gilderoy.",
    "He remained true to his character, when he ripped up the belly of his betrayer.",
    "This was the closing act of his life.",
    "Rann, also, was consistent, even to the gallows.",
    "The night before his death he entertained seven women at supper, and outlaughed them all.",
    "The contrast is not so violent as it appears.",
    "The one act is melodrama, the other farce.",
    "And what is farce, but melodrama in a happier shape?",
    "THOMAS PURENEY, Archbishop among Ordinaries, lived and preached in the heyday of Newgate.",
    "His was the good fortune to witness Sheppard's encounter with the topsman, and to shrive the battered soul of Jonathan Wild.",
    "Nor did he fall one inch below his opportunity.",
    "Designed by Providence to administer a final consolation to the evil-doer, he permitted no false ambition to distract his talent.",
    "As some men are born for the gallows, so he was born to thump the cushion of a prison pulpit; and his peculiar aptitude was revealed to him before he had time to spend his strength in mistaken endeavour.",
    "For thirty years his squat, stout figure was amiably familiar to all such as enjoyed the Liberties of the Jug.",
    "For thirty years his mottled nose and the rubicundity of his cheeks were the ineffaceable ensigns of his intemperance.",
    "Yet there was a grimy humour in his forbidding aspect.",
    "The fusty black coat, which sat ill upon his shambling frame, was all besmirched with spilled snuff, and the lees of a thousand quart pots.",
    "The bands of his profession were ever awry upon a tattered shirt.",
    "His ancient wig scattered dust and powder as he went, while a single buckle of some tawdry metal gave a look of oddity to his clumsy, slipshod feet.",
    "A caricature of a man, he ambled and chuckled and seized the easy pleasures within his reach.",
    "There was never a summer's day but he caught upon his brow the few faint gleams of sunlight that penetrated the gloomy yard.",
    "Hour after hour he would sit, his short fingers hardly linked across his belly, drinking his cup of ale, and puffing at a half-extinguished tobacco-pipe.",
    "Meanwhile he would reflect upon those triumphs of oratory which were his supreme delight.",
    "If it fell on a Monday that he took the air, a smile of satisfaction lit up his fat, loose features, for still he pondered the effect of yesterday's masterpiece.",
    "On Saturday the glad expectancy of to-morrow lent him a certain joyous dignity.",
    "At other times his eye lacked lustre, his gesture buoyancy, unless indeed he were called upon to follow the cart to Tyburn, or to compose the Last Dying Speech of some notorious malefactor.",
    "Preaching was the master passion of his life.",
    "It was the pulpit that reconciled him to exile within a great city, and persuaded him to the enjoyment of roguish company.",
    "Those there were who deemed his career unfortunate; but a sense of fitness might have checked their pity, and it was only in his hours of maudlin confidence that the Reverend Thomas confessed to disappointment.",
    "Born of respectable parents in the County of Cambridgeshire, he nurtured his youth upon the exploits of James Hind and the Golden Farmer.",
    "His boyish pleasure was to lie in the ditch, which bounded his father's orchard, studying that now forgotten masterpiece, 'There's no Jest like a True Jest.'",
    "Then it was that he felt 'immortal longings in his blood.'",
    "He would take to the road, so he swore, and hold up his enemies like a gentleman.",
    "Once, indeed, he was surprised by the clergyman of the parish in act to escape from the rectory with two volumes of sermons and a silver flagon.",
    "The divine was minded to speak seriously to him concerning the dreadful sin of robbery, and having strengthened him with texts and good counsel, to send him forth unpunished.",
    "'Thieving and covetousness,' said the parson, 'must inevitably bring you to the gallows.",
    "If you would die in your bed, repent you of your evildoing, and rob no more.'",
    "The exhortation was not lost upon Pureney, who, chastened in spirit, straightly prevailed upon his father to enter him a pensioner at Corpus Christi College in the University of Cambridge, that at the proper time he might take orders.",
    "At Cambridge he gathered no more knowledge than was necessary for his profession, and wasted such hours as should have been given to study in drinking, dicing, and even less reputable pleasures.",
    "Yet repentance was always easy, and he accepted his first curacy, at Newmarket, with a brave heart and a good hopefulness.",
    "Fortunate was the choice of this early cure.",
    "Had he been gently guided at the outset, who knows but he might have lived out his life in respectable obscurity?",
    "But Newmarket then, as now, was a town of jollity and dissipation, and Pureney yielded without persuasion to the pleasures denied his cloth.",
    "There was ever a fire to extinguish at his throat, nor could he veil his wanton eye at the sight of a pretty wench.",
    "Again and again the lust of preaching urged him to repent, yet he slid back upon his past gaiety, until Parson Pureney became a byword.",
    "Dismissed from Newmarket in disgrace, he wandered the country up and down in search of a pulpit, but so infamous became the habit of his life that only in prison could he find an audience fit and responsive.",
    "And, in the nick, the chaplaincy of Newgate fell vacant.",
    "Here was the occasion to temper dissipation with piety, to indulge the twofold ambition of his life.",
    "What mattered it, if within the prison walls he dipped his nose more deeply into the punch-bowl than became a divine?",
    "The rascals would but respect him the more for his prowess, and knit more closely the bond of sympathy.",
    "Besides, after preaching and punch he best loved a penitent, and where in the world could he find so rich a crop of erring souls ripe for repentance as in gaol?",
    "Henceforth he might threaten, bluster, and cajole.",
    "If amiability proved fruitless he would put cruelty to the test, and terrify his victims by a spirited reference to Hell and to that Burning Lake they were so soon to traverse.",
    "At last, thought he, I shall be sure of my effect, and the prospect flattered his vanity.",
    "In truth, he won an immediate and assured success.",
    "Like the common file or cracksman, he fell into the habit of the place, intriguing with all the cleverness of a practised diplomatist, and setting one party against the other that he might in due season decide the trumpery dispute.",
    "The trusted friend of many a distinguished prig and murderer, he so intimately mastered the slang and etiquette of the Jug, that he was appointed arbiter of all those nice questions of honour which agitated the more reputable among the cross-coves.",
    "But these were the diversions of a strenuous mind, and it was in the pulpit or in the closet that the Reverend Thomas Pureney revealed his true talent.",
    "As the ruffian had a sense of drama, so he was determined that his words should scald and bite the penitent.",
    "When the condemned pew was full of a Sunday his happiness was complete.",
    "Now his deep chest would hurl salvo on salvo of platitudes against the sounding-board; now his voice, lowered to a whisper, would coax the hopeless prisoners to prepare their souls.",
    "In a paroxysm of feigned anger he would crush the cushion with his clenched fist, or leaning over the pulpit side as though to approach the nearer to his victims, would roll a cold and bitter eye upon them, as of a cat watching caged birds.",
    "One famous gesture was irresistible, and he never employed it but some poor ruffian fell senseless to the floor.",
    "His stumpy fingers would fix a noose of air round some imagined neck, and so devoutly was the pantomime studied that you almost heard the creak of the retreating cart as the phantom culprit was turned off.",
    "But his conduct in the pulpit was due to no ferocity of temperament.",
    "He merely exercised his legitimate craft.",
    "So long as Newgate supplied him with an enforced audience, so long would he thunder and bluster at the wrongdoer according to law and the dictates of his conscience.",
    "Many, in truth, were his triumphs, but, as he would mutter in his garrulous old age, never was he so successful as in the last exhortation delivered to Matthias Brinsden.",
    "Now, Matthias Brinsden incontinently murdered his wife because she harboured too eager a love of the brandy-shop.",
    "A model husband, he had spared no pains in her correction.",
    "He had flogged her without mercy and without result.",
    "His one design was to make his wife obey him, which, as the Scriptures say, all wives should do.",
    "But the lust of brandy overcame wifely obedience, and Brinsden, hoping for the best, was constrained to cut a hole in her skull.",
    "The next day she was as impudent as ever, until Matthias rose yet more fiercely in his wrath, and the shrew perished.",
    "Then was Thomas Pureney's opportunity, and the Sunday following the miscreant's condemnation he delivered unto him and seventeen other malefactors the moving discourse which here follows:   'We shall take our text,' gruffed the Ordinary 'From out the Psalms: \"Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days.\"",
    "And firstly, we shall expound to you the heinous sin of murder, which is unlawful (1) according to the Natural Laws, (2) according to the Jewish Law, (3) according to the Christian Law, proportionably stronger.",
    "By Nature 'tis unlawful as 'tis injuring Society: as 'tis robbing God of what is His Right and Property; as 'tis depriving the Slain of the satisfaction of Eating, Drinking, Talking, and the Light of the Sun, which it is his right to enjoy.",
    "And especially 'tis unlawful, as it is sending a Soul naked and unprepared to appear before a wrathful and avenging Deity without time to make his Soul composedly or to listen to the thoughtful ministrations of one (like ourselves) soundly versed in Divinity.",
    "By the Jewish Law 'tis forbidden, for is it not written (Gen. ix.",
    "6): \"Whosoever sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man his Blood shall be shed\"?",
    "And if an Eye be given for an Eye, a Tooth for a Tooth, how shall the Murderer escape with his dishonoured Life?",
    "'Tis further forbidden by the Christian Law (proportionably stronger).",
    "But on this head we would speak no word, for were not you all, O miserable Sinners, born not in the Darkness of Heathendom, but in the burning Light of Christian England?",
    "'Secondly, we will consider the peculiar wickedness of Parricide, and especially the Murder of a Wife.",
    "What deed, in truth, is more heinous than that a man should slay the Parent of his own Children, the Wife he had once loved and chose out of all the world to be a Companion of his Days; the Wife who long had shared his good Fortune and his ill, who had brought him with Pain and Anguish several Tokens and Badges of Affection, the Olive Branches round about his Table?",
    "To embrew the hands in such blood is double Murder, as it murders not only the Person slain, but kills the Happiness of the orphaned Children, depriving them of Bread, and forcing them upon wicked Ways of getting a Maintenance, which often terminate in Newgate and an ignominious death.",
    "'Bloodthirsty men, we have said, shall not live out half their Days.",
    "And think not that Repentance avails the Murderer.",
    "\"Hell and Damnation are never full\" (Prov.",
    "xxvii.",
    "20), and the meanest Sinner shall find a place in the Lake which burns unto Eternity with Fire and Brimstone.",
    "Alas!",
    "your Punishment shall not finish with the Noose.",
    "Your \"end is to be burned\" (Heb.",
    "vi.",
    "8), to be burned, for the Blood that is shed cries aloud for Vengeance.'",
    "At these words, as Pureney would relate with a smile of recollected triumph, Matthias Brinsden screamed aloud, and a shiver ran through the idle audience which came to Newgate on a Black Sunday, as to a bull-baiting.",
    "Truly, the throng of thoughtless spectators hindered the proper solace of the Ordinary's ministrations, and many a respectable murderer complained of the intruding mob.",
    "But the Ordinary, otherwise minded, loved nothing so well as a packed house, and though he would invite the criminal to his private closet, and comfort his solitude with pious ejaculations, he would neither shield him from curiosity, nor tranquillise his path to the unquenchable fire.",
    "Not only did he exercise in the pulpit a poignant and visible influence.",
    "He boasted the confidence of many heroes.",
    "His green old age cherished no more famous memory than the friendship of Jonathan Wild.",
    "He had known the Great Man at his zenith; he had wrestled with him in the hour of discomfiture; he had preached for his benefit that famous sermon on the text: 'Hide Thy Face from my sins, and blot out all my Iniquities'; he had witnessed the hero's awful progress from Newgate to Tyburn; he had seen him shiver at the nubbing-cheat; he had composed for him a last dying speech, which did not shame the king of thief-takers, and whose sale brought a comfortable profit to the widow.",
    "Jonathan, on his side, had shown the Ordinary not a little condescension.",
    "It had been his whim, on the eve of his marriage, to present Mr. Pureney with a pair of white gloves, which were treasured as a priceless relic for many a year.",
    "And when he paid his last, forced visit to Newgate, he gave the Chaplain, for a pledge of his esteem, that famous silver staff, which he carried, as a badge of authority from the Government, the better to keep the people in awe, and favour the enterprises of his rogues.",
    "Only one cloud shadowed this old and equal friendship.",
    "Jonathan had entertained the Ordinary with discourse so familiar, they had cracked so many a bottle together, that when the irrevocable sentence was passed, when he who had never shown mercy, expected none, the Great Man found the exhortations of the illiterate Chaplain insufficient for his high purpose.",
    "'As soon as I came into the condemned Hole,' thus he wrote, 'I began to think of making a preparation for my soul; and the better to bring my stubborn heart to repentance, I desired the advice of a man of learning, a man of sound judgment in divinity, and therefore application being made to the Reverend Mr. Nicholson, he very Christian-like gave me his assistance.'",
    "Alas!",
    "Poor Pureney!",
    "He lacked subtlety, and he was instantly baffled, when the Great Man bade him expound the text: 'Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.'",
    "The shiftiest excuse would have brought solace to a breaking heart and conviction to a casuist brain.",
    "Yet for once the Ordinary was at a loss, and Wild, finding him insufficient for his purpose, turned a deaf ear to his ministrations.",
    "Thus he was rudely awakened from the dream of many sleepless nights.",
    "His large heart almost broke at the neglect.",
    "But if his more private counsels were scorned, he still had the joy of delivering a masterpiece from the pulpit, of using 'all the means imaginable to make Wild think of another world,' and of seeing him as neatly turned off as the most exacting Ordinary could desire.",
    "And what inmate of Newgate ever forgot the afternoon of that glorious day (May the 24th, 1725)?",
    "Mr. Pureney returned to his flock, fortified with punch and good tidings.",
    "He pictured the scene at Tyburn with a bibulous circumstance, which admirably became his style, rejoicing, as he has rejoiced ever since, that, though he lost a friend, the honest rogue was saved at last from the machinations of the thief-taker.",
    "So he basked and smoked and drank his ale, retelling the ancient stories, and hiccuping forth the ancient sermons.",
    "So, in the fading twilight of life, he smiled the smile of contentment, as became one who had emptied more quarts, had delivered more harrowing discourses, and had lived familiarly with more scoundrels than any devil-dodger of his generation.",
    "IT was midnight when Jack Sheppard reached the leads, wearied by his magical achievement, and still fearful of discovery.",
    "The 'jolly pair of handcuffs,' provided by the thoughtful Governor, lay discarded in his distant cell; the chains which a few hours since had grappled him to the floor encumbered the now useless staple.",
    "No trace of the ancient slavery disgraced him save the iron anklets which clung about his legs; though many a broken wall and shattered lock must serve for evidence of his prowess on the morrow.",
    "The Stone-Jug was all be-chipped and shattered.",
    "From the castle he had forced his way through a nine-foot wall into the Red Room, whose bolts, bars, and hinges he had ruined to gain the Chapel.",
    "The road thence to the roof and to freedom was hindered by three stubborn iron doors; yet naught stood in the way of Sheppard's genius, and he was sensible, at last, of the night air chill upon his cheek.",
    "But liberty was not yet: there was still a fall of forty feet, and he must needs repass the wreckage of his own making to filch the blankets from his cell.",
    "In terror lest he should awaken the Master-Side Debtors, he hastened back to the roof, lashed the coverlets together, and, as the city clocks clashed twelve, he dropped noiselessly upon the leads of a turner's house, built against the prison's outer wall.",
    "Behind him Newgate was cut out a black mass against the sky; at his feet glimmered the garret window of the turner's house, and behind the winking casement he could see the turner's servant going to bed.",
    "Through her chamber lay the road to glory and Clare Market, and breathlessly did Sheppard watch till the candle should be extinguished and the maid silenced in sleep.",
    "In his anxiety he must tarry-tarry; and for a weary hour he kicked his heels upon the leads, ambition still too uncertain for quietude.",
    "Yet he could not but catch a solace from his splendid craft.",
    "Said he to himself: 'Am I not the most accomplished slip-string the world has known?",
    "The broken wall of every round house in town attests my bravery.",
    "Light-limbed though I be, have I not forced the impregnable Castle itself?",
    "And my enemies-are they not to-day writhing in distress ?",
    "The head of Blueskin, that pitiful thief, quivers in the noose; and Jonathan Wild bleeds at the throat from the dregs of a coward's courage.",
    "What a triumph shall be mine when the Keeper finds the stronghold tenantless!'",
    "Now, unnumbered were the affronts he had suffered from the Keeper's impertinence, and he chuckled aloud at his own witty rejoinder.",
    "Only two days since the Gaoler had caught him tampering with his irons.",
    "'Young man,' he had said, 'I see what you have been doing, but the affair betwixt us stands thus: It is your business to make your escape, and mine to take care you shall not.'",
    "Jack had answered coolly enough: 'Then let's both mind our own business.'",
    "And it was to some purpose that he had minded his.",
    "The letter to his baffled guardian, already sketched in his mind, tickled him afresh, when suddenly he leaps to his feet and begins to force the garret window.",
    "The turner's maid was a heavy sleeper, and Sheppard crept from her garret to the twisted stair in peace.",
    "Once, on a lower floor, his heart beat faster at the trumpetings of the turner's nose, but he knew no check until he reached the street door.",
    "The bolt was withdrawn in an instant, but the lock was turned, and the key nowhere to be found.",
    "However, though the risk of disturbance was greater than in Newgate, the task was light enough: and with an iron link from his fetter, and a rusty nail which had served him bravely, the box was wrenched off in a trice, and Sheppard stood unattended in the Old Bailey.",
    "At first he was minded to make for his ancient haunts, or to conceal himself within the Liberty of Westminster; but the fetter-locks were still upon his legs, and he knew that detection would be easy as long as he was thus embarrassed.",
    "Wherefore, weary and an-hungered, he turned his steps northward, and never rested until he had gained Finchley Common.",
    "At break of day, when the world re-awoke from the fear of thieves, he feigned a limp at a cottage door, and borrowed a hammer to straighten a pinching shoe.",
    "Five minutes behind a hedge, and his anklets had dropped from him; and, thus a free man, he took to the high road.",
    "After all he was persuaded to desert London and to escape a while from the sturdy embrace of Edgworth Bess.",
    "Moreover, if Bess herself were in the lock-up, he still feared the interested affection of Mistress Maggot, that other doxy, whose avarice would surely drive him upon a dangerous enterprise; so he struck across country, and kept starvation from him by petty theft.",
    "Up and down England he wandered in solitary insolence.",
    "Once, saith rumour, his lithe apparition startled the peace of Nottingham; once, he was wellnigh caught begging wort at a brew-house in Thames Street.",
    "But he might as well have lingered in Newgate as waste his opportunity far from the delights of Town; the old lust of life still impelled him, and a week after the hue-and-cry was raised he crept at dead of night down Drury Lane.",
    "Here he found harbourage with a friendly fence, Wild's mortal enemy, who promised him a safe conduct across the seas.",
    "But the desire of work proved too strong for prudence; and in a fortnight he had planned an attack on the pawnshop of one Rawling, at the Four Balls in Drury Lane.",
    "Sheppard, whom no house ever built with hands was strong enough to hold, was better skilled at breaking out than at breaking in, and it is remarkable that his last feat in the cracking of cribs was also his greatest.",
    "Its very conception was a masterpiece of effrontery.",
    "Drury Lane was the thief-catcher's chosen territory; yet it was the Four Balls that Jack designed for attack, and watches, tie-wigs, snuff-boxes were among his booty.",
    "Whatever he could not crowd upon his person he presented to a brace of women.",
    "Tricked out in his stolen finery, he drank and swaggered in Clare Market.",
    "He was dressed in a superb suit of black; a diamond fawney flashed upon his finger; his light tie-periwig was worth no less than seven pounds; pistols, tortoise-shell snuff-boxes, and golden guineas jostled one another in his pockets.",
    "Thus, in brazen magnificence, he marched down Drury Lane on a certain Saturday night in November 1724.",
    "Towards midnight he visited Thomas Nicks, the butcher, and having bargained for three ribs of beef, carried Nicks with him to a chandler's hard by, that they might ratify the bargain with a dram.",
    "Unhappily, a boy from the 'Rose and Crown' sounded the alarm; for coming into the chandler's for the empty ale-pots, he instantly recognised the incomparable gaol-thief, and lost no time in acquainting his master.",
    "Now, Mr. Bradford, of the 'Rose and Crown,' was a head-borough, who, with the zeal of a triumphant Dogberry, summoned the watch, and in less than half an hour Jack Sheppard was screaming blasphemies in a hackney-cab on his way home to Newgate.",
    "The Stone-Jug received him with deference and admiration.",
    "Three hundred pounds weight of irons were put upon him for an adornment, and the Governor professed so keen a solicitude for his welfare that he never left him unattended.",
    "There was scarce a beautiful woman in London who did not solace him with her condescension, and enrich him with her gifts.",
    "Not only did the President of the Royal Academy deign to paint his portrait, but (a far greater honour) Hogarth made him immortal.",
    "Even the King displayed a proper interest, demanding a full and precise account of his escapes.",
    "The hero himself was drunk with flattery; he bubbled with ribaldry; he touched off the most valiant of his contemporaries in a ludicrous phrase.",
    "But his chief delight was to illustrate his prowess to his distinguished visitors, and nothing pleased him better than to slip in and out of his chains.",
    "Confronted with his judge, he forthwith proposed to rid himself of his handcuffs, and he preserved until the fatal tree an illimitable pride in his artistry.",
    "Nor would he believe in the possibility of death.",
    "To the very last he was confirmed in the hope of pardon; but, pardon failing him, his single consolation was that his procession from Westminster to Newgate was the largest that London had ever known, and that in the crowd a constable broke his leg.",
    "Even in the Condemned Hole he was unreconciled.",
    "If he had broken the Castle, why should he not also evade the gallows?",
    "Wherefore he resolved to carry a knife to Tyburn that he might cut the rope, and so, losing himself in the crowd, ensure escape.",
    "But the knife was discovered by his warder's vigilance, and taken from him after a desperate struggle.",
    "At the scaffold he behaved with admirable gravity: confessing the wickeder of his robberies, and asking pardon for his enormous crimes.",
    "'Of two virtues,' he boasted at the self-same moment that the cart left him dancing without the music, 'I have ever cherished an honest pride: never have I stooped to friendship with Jonathan Wild, or with any of his detestable thief-takers; and, though an undutiful son, I never damned my mother's eyes.'",
    "Thus died Jack Sheppard; intrepid burglar and incomparable artist, who, in his own separate ambition of prison-breaking, remains, and will ever remain, unrivalled.",
    "His most brilliant efforts were the result neither of strength nor of cunning; for so slight was he of build, so deficient in muscle, that both Edgworth Bess and Mistress Maggot were wont to bang him to their own mind and purpose.",
    "And an escape so magnificently planned, so bravely executed as was his from the Strong Room, is far greater than a mere effect of cunning.",
    "Those mysterious gifts which enable mankind to batter the stone walls of a prison, or to bend the iron bars of a cage, were pre-eminently his.",
    "It is also certain that he could not have employed his gifts in a more reputable profession.",
    "Of all the heroes who have waged a private and undeclared war upon their neighbours, Louis-Dominique Cartouche was the most generously endowed.",
    "It was but his resolute contempt for politics, his unswerving love of plunder for its own sake, that prevented him from seizing a throne or questing after the empire of the world.",
    "The modesty of his ambition sets him below Caesar, or Napoleon, but he yields to neither in the genius of success: whatever he would attain was his on the instant, nor did failure interrupt his career, until treachery, of which he went in perpetual terror, involved himself and his comrades in ruin.",
    "His talent of generalship was unrivalled.",
    "None of the gang was permitted the liberty of a free-lance.",
    "By Cartouche was the order given, and so long as the chief was in repose, Paris might enjoy her sleep.",
    "When it pleased him to join battle a whistle was enough.",
    "Now, it was revealed to his intelligence that the professional thief, who devoted all his days and such of his nights as were spared from depredation to wine and women, was more readily detected than the valet-de-chambre, who did but crack a crib or cry 'Stand and deliver!'",
    "on a proper occasion.",
    "Wherefore, he bade his soldiers take service in the great houses of Paris, that, secure of suspicion, they might still be ready to obey the call of duty.",
    "Thus, also, they formed a reconnoitring force, whose vigilance no prize might elude; and nowhere did Cartouche display his genius to finer purpose than in this prudent disposition of his army.",
    "It remained only to efface himself, and therein he succeeded admirably by never sleeping two following nights in the same house: so that, when Cartouche was the terror of Paris, when even the King trembled in his bed, none knew his stature nor could recognise his features.",
    "In this shifting and impersonal vizard, he broke houses, picked pockets, robbed on the pad.",
    "One night he would terrify the Faubourg St. Germain; another he would plunder the humbler suburb of St. Antoine; but on each excursion he was companioned by experts, and the map of Paris was rigidly apportioned among his followers.",
    "To each district a captain was appointed, whose business it was to apprehend the customs of the quarter, and thus to indicate the proper season of attack.",
    "Ever triumphant, with yellow-boys ever jingling in his pocket, Cartouche lived a life of luxurious merriment.",
    "A favourite haunt was a cabaret in the Rue Dauphine, chosen for the sanest of reasons, as his Captain Ferrand declared, that the landlady was a femme d'esprit.",
    "Here he would sit with his friends and his women, and thereafter drive his chariot across the Pont Neuf to the sunnier gaiety of the Palais-Royal.",
    "A finished dandy, he wore by preference a grey-white coat with silver buttons; his breeches and stockings were on a famous occasion of black silk; while a sword, scabbarded in satin, hung at his hip.",
    "But if Cartouche, like many another great man, had the faculty of enjoyment, if he loved wine and wit, and mistresses handsomely attired in damask, he did not therefore neglect his art.",
    "When once the gang was perfectly ordered, murder followed robbery with so instant a frequency that Paris was panic-stricken.",
    "A cry of 'Cartouche' straightway ensured an empty street.",
    "The King took counsel with his ministers: munificent rewards were offered, without effect.",
    "The thief was still at work in all security, and it was a pretty irony which urged him to strip and kill on the highway one of the King's own pages.",
    "Also, he did his work with so astonishing a silence, with so reasoned a certainty, that it seemed impossible to take him or his minions red-handed.",
    "Before all, he discouraged the use of firearms.",
    "'A pistol,' his philosophy urged, 'is an excellent weapon in an emergency, but reserve it for emergencies.",
    "At close quarters it is none too sure; and why give the alarm against yourself?'",
    "Therefore he armed his band with loaded staves, which sent their enemies into a noiseless and fatal sleep.",
    "Thus was he wont to laugh at the police, deeming capture a plain impossibility.",
    "The traitor, in sooth, was his single, irremediable fear, and if ever suspicion was aroused against a member of the gang, that member was put to death with the shortest shrift.",
    "It happened in the last year of Cartouche's supremacy that a lily-livered comrade fell in love with a pretty dressmaker.",
    "The indiscretion was the less pardonable since the dressmaker had a horror of theft, and impudently tried to turn her lover from his trade.",
    "Cartouche, discovering the backslider, resolved upon a public exhibition.",
    "Before the assembled band he charged the miscreant with treason, and, cutting his throat, disfigured his face beyond recognition.",
    "Thereafter he pinned to the corse the following inscription, that others might be warned by so monstrous an example: 'Ci git Jean Rebati, qui a eu le traitement qu'il meritait: ceux qui en feront autant que lui peuvent attendre le meme sort.'",
    "Yet this was the murder that led to the hero's own capture and death.",
    "Du Chatelet, another craven, had already aroused the suspicions of his landlady: who, finding him something troubled the day after the traitor's death, and detecting a spot of blood on his neckerchief, questioned him closely.",
    "The coward fumbling at an answer, she was presently convinced of his guilt, and forthwith denounced him for a member of the gang to M. Pacome, an officer of the Guard.",
    "Straightly did M. Pacome summon Du Chtelet, and, assuming his guilt for certitude, bade him surrender his captain.",
    "'My friend,' said he, 'I know you for an associate of Cartouche.",
    "Your hands are soiled with murder and rapine.",
    "Confess the hiding-place of Cartouche, or in twenty-four hours you are broken on the wheel.'",
    "Vainly did Du Chatelet protest his ignorance.",
    "M. Pacome was resolute, and before the interview was over the robber confessed that Cartouche had given him rendezvous at nine next day.",
    "In the grey morning thirty soldiers crept forth guided by the traitor, 'en habits de bourgeois et de chasseur,' for the house where Cartouche had lain.",
    "It was an inn, kept by one Savard, near la Haulte Borne de la Courtille; and the soldiers, though they lacked not numbers, approached the chieftain's lair shaking with terror.",
    "In front marched Du Chatelet; the rest followed in Indian file, ten paces apart.",
    "When the traitor reached the house, Savard recognised him for a friend, and entertained him with familiar speech.",
    "'Is there anybody upstairs?'",
    "demanded Du Chatelet.",
    "'No,' replied Savard.",
    "'Are the four women upstairs?'",
    "asked Du Chatelet again.",
    "'Yes, they are,' came the answer: for Savard knew the password of the day.",
    "Instantly the soldiers filled the tavern, and, mounting the staircase, discovered Cartouche with his three lieutenants, Balagny, Limousin, and Blanchard.",
    "One of the four still lay abed; but Cartouche, with all the dandy's respect for his clothes, was mending his breeches.",
    "The others hugged a flagon of wine over the fire.",
    "So fell the scourge of Paris into the grip of justice.",
    "But once under lock and key, he displayed all the qualities which made him supreme.",
    "His gaiety broke forth into a light-hearted contempt of his gaolers, and the Lieutenant Criminel, who would interrogate him, was covered with ridicule.",
    "Not for an instant did he bow to fate: all shackled as he was, his legs engarlanded in heavy chains-which he called his garters-he tempered his merriment with the meditation of escape.",
    "From the first he denied all knowledge of Cartouche, insisting that his name was Charles Bourguignon, and demanding burgundy, that he might drink to his country and thus prove him a true son of the soil.",
    "Not even the presence of his mother and brother abashed him.",
    "He laughed them away as impostors, hired by a false justice to accuse and to betray the innocent.",
    "No word of confession crossed his lips, and he would still entertain the officers of the law with joke and epigram.",
    "Thus he won over a handful of the Guard, and, begging for solitude, he straightway set about escape with a courage and an address which Jack Sheppard might have envied.",
    "His delicate ear discovered that a cellar lay beneath his cell; and with the old nail which lies on the floor of every prison he made his way downwards into a boxmaker's shop.",
    "But a barking dog spoiled the enterprise: the boxmaker and his daughter were immediately abroad, and once more Cartouche was lodged in prison, weighted with still heavier garters.",
    "Then came a period of splendid notoriety: he held his court, he gave an easy rein to his wit, he received duchesses and princes with an air of amiable patronage.",
    "Few there were of his visitants who left him without a present of gold, and thus the universal robber was further rewarded by his victims.",
    "His portrait hung in every house, and his thin, hard face, his dry, small features were at last familiar to the whole of France.",
    "M. Grandval made him the hero of an epic-'Le Vice Puni.'",
    "Even the theatre was dominated by his presence; and while Arlequin-Cartouche was greeted with thunders of applause at the Italiens, the more serious Francais set Cartouche upon the stage in three acts, and lavished upon its theme the resources of a then intelligent art.",
    "M. Le Grand, author of the piece, deigned to call upon the king of thieves, spoke some words of argot with him, and by way of conscience money gave him a hundred crowns.",
    "Cartouche set little store by such patronage.",
    "He pocketed the crowns, and then put an end to the comedy by threatening that if it were played again the companions of Cartouche would punish all such miscreants as dared to make him a laughing stock.",
    "For Cartouche would endure ridicule at no man's hand.",
    "At the very instant of his arrest, all bare-footed as he was, he kicked a constable who presumed to smile at his discomfiture.",
    "His last days were spent in resolute abandonment.",
    "True, he once attempted to beat out his brains with the fetters that bound him; true, also, he took a poison that had been secretly conveyed within the prison.",
    "But both attempts failed, and, more scrupulously watched, he had no other course than jollity.",
    "Lawyers and priests he visited with a like and bitter scorn, and when, on November 27, 1721, he was led to the scaffold, not a word of confession or contrition had been dragged from him.",
    "To the last moment he cherished the hope of rescue, and eagerly he scanned the crowd for the faces of his comrades.",
    "But the gang, trusting to its leader's nobility, had broken its oath.",
    "With contemptuous dignity Cartouche determined upon revenge: proudly he turned to the priest, begging a respite and the opportunity of speech.",
    "Forgotten by his friends, he resolved to spare no single soul: he betrayed even his mistresses to justice.",
    "Of his gang, forty were in the service of Mlle.",
    "de Montpensier, who was already in Spain; while two obeyed the Duchesse de Ventadour as valets-de-pied.",
    "His confession, in brief, was so dangerous a document, it betrayed the friends and servants of so many great houses, that the officers of the Law found safety for their patrons in its destruction, and not a line of the hero's testimony remains.",
    "The trial of his comrades dragged on for many a year, and after Cartouche had been cruelly broken on the wheel, not a few of the gang, of which he had been at once the terror and inspiration, suffered a like fate.",
    "Such the career and such the fitting end of the most distinguished marauder the world has known.",
    "Thackeray, with no better guide than a chap-book, was minded to belittle him, now habiting him like a scullion, now sending him forth on some petty errand of cly-faking.",
    "But for all Thackeray's contempt his fame is still undimmed, and he has left the reputation of one who, as thief unrivalled, had scarce his equal as wit and dandy even in the days when Louis the Magnificent was still a memory and an example.",
    "IF the seventeenth century was the golden age of the hightobyman, it was at the advent of the eighteenth that the burglar and street-robber plied their trade with the most distinguished success, and it was the good fortune of both Cartouche and Sheppard to be born in the nick of time.",
    "Rivals in talent, they were also near contemporaries, and the Scourge of Paris may well have been famous in the purlieus of Clare Market before Jack the Slip-String paid the last penalty of his crimes.",
    "As each of these great men harboured a similar ambition, so their careers are closely parallel.",
    "Born in a humble rank of life, Jack, like Cartouche, was the architect of his own fortune; Jack, like Cartouche, lived to be flattered by noble dames and to claim the solicitude of his Sovereign; and each owed his pre-eminence rather to natural genius than to a sympathetic training.",
    "But, for all the Briton's artistry, the Frenchman was in all points save one the superior.",
    "Sheppard's brain carried him not beyond the wants of to-day and the extortions of Poll Maggot.",
    "Who knows but he might have been a respectable citizen, with never a chance for the display of his peculiar talent, had not hunger and his mistress's greed driven him upon the pad?",
    "History records no brilliant robbery of his own planning, and so circumscribed was his imagination that he must needs pick out his own friends and benefactors for depredation.",
    "His paltry sense of discipline permitted him to be betrayed even by his brother and pupil, and there was no cracksman of his time over whose head he held the rod of terror.",
    "Even his hatred of Jonathan Wild was the result not of policy but of prejudice.",
    "Cartouche, on the other hand, was always perfect when at work.",
    "The master of himself, he was also the master of his fellows.",
    "There was no detail of civil war that he had not made his own, and he still remains, after nearly two centuries, the greatest captain the world has seen.",
    "Never did he permit an enterprise to fail by accident; never was he impelled by hunger or improvidence to fight a battle unprepared.",
    "His means were always neatly fitted to their end, as is proved by the truth that, throughout his career, he was arrested but once, and then not by his own inadvertence but by the treachery of others.",
    "Yet from the moment of arrest Jack Sheppard asserted his magnificent superiority.",
    "If Cartouche was a sorry bungler at prison-breaking, Sheppard was unmatched in this dangerous art.",
    "The sport of the one was to break in, of the other to break out.",
    "True, the Briton proved his inferiority by too frequently placing himself under lock and key; but you will forgive his every weakness for the unexampled skill wherewith he extricated himself from the stubbornest dungeon.",
    "Cartouche would scarce have given Sheppard a menial's office in his gang.",
    "How cordially Sheppard would have despised Cartouche's solitary experiment in escape!",
    "To be foiled by a dog and a boxmaker's daughter!",
    "Would not that have seemed contemptible to the master breaker of those unnumbered doors and walls which separate the Castle from the freedom of Newgate roof?",
    "Such, then, is the contrast between the heroes.",
    "Sheppard claims our admiration for one masterpiece.",
    "Cartouche has a sheaf of works, which shall carry him triumphantly to the remotest future.",
    "And when you forget a while professional rivalry, and consider the delicacies of leisure, you will find the Frenchman's greatness still indisputable.",
    "At all points he was the prettier gentleman.",
    "Sheppard, to be sure, had a sense of finery, but he was so unused to grandeur that vulgarity always spoiled his effects.",
    "When he hied him from the pawnshop, laden with booty, he must e'en cram what he could not wear into his pockets; and doubtless his vulgar lack of reticence made detection easier.",
    "Cartouche, on the other hand, had an unfailing sense of proportion, and was never more dressed than became the perfect dandy.",
    "He was elegant, he was polished, he was joyous.",
    "He drank wine, while the other soaked himself in beer; he despised whatever was common, while his rival knew but the coarser flavours of life.",
    "The one was distinguished by a boisterous humour, a swaggering pride in his own prowess; the wit of the other might be edged like a knife, nor would he ever appeal for a spectacle to the curiosity of the mob.",
    "Both were men of many mistresses, but again in his conduct with women Cartouche showed an honester talent.",
    "Sheppard was at once the prey and the whipping-block of his two infamous doxies, who agreed in deformity of feature as in contempt for their lover.",
    "Cartouche, on the other hand, chose his cabaret for the wit of its patronne, and was always happy in the elegance and accomplishment of his companions.",
    "One point of likeness remains.",
    "The two heroes resembled each other not only in their profession, but in their person.",
    "Though their trade demanded physical strength, each was small and slender of build.",
    "'A little, slight-limbed lad,' says the historian of Sheppard.",
    "'A thin, spare frame,' sings the poet of Cartouche.",
    "Here, then, neither had the advantage, and if in the shades Cartouche despises the clumsiness and vulgarity of his rival, Sheppard may still remember the glory of Newgate, and twit the Frenchman with the barking of the boxmaker's dog.",
    "But genius is the talent of the dead, and the wise, who are not partisans, will not deny to the one or to the other the possession of the rarer gift.",
    "TO Haggart, who babbled on the Castle Rock of Willie Wallace and was only nineteen when he danced without the music; to Simms, alias Gentleman Harry, who showed at Tyburn how a hero could die; to George Barrington, the incomparably witty and adroit-to these a full meed of honour has been paid.",
    "Even the coarse and dastardly Freney has achieved, with Thackeray's aid (and Lever's) something of a reputation.",
    "But James Hardy Vaux, despite his eloquent bid for fame, has not found his rhapsodist.",
    "Yet a more consistent ruffian never pleaded for mercy.",
    "From his early youth until in 1819 he sent forth his Memoirs to the world, he lived industriously upon the cross.",
    "There was no racket but he worked it with energy and address.",
    "Though he practised the more glorious crafts of pickpocket and shoplifter, he did not despise the begging-letter, and he suffered his last punishment for receiving what another's courage had conveyed.",
    "His enterprise was not seldom rewarded with success, and for a decade of years he continued to preserve an appearance of gentility; but it is plain, even from his own narrative, that he was scarce an artist, and we shall best understand him if we recognise that he was a Philistine among thieves.",
    "He lived in an age of pocket-picking, and skill in this branch is the true test of his time.",
    "A contemporary of Barrington, he had before him the most brilliant of examples, which might properly have enforced the worth of a simple method.",
    "But, though he constantly brags of his success at Drury Lane, we take not his generalities for gospel, and the one exploit whose credibility is enforced with circumstance was pitiful both in conception and performance.",
    "A meeting of freeholders at the 'Mermaid Tavern,' Hackney, was the occasion, and after drawing blank upon blank, Vaux succeeded at last in extracting a silver snuff-box.",
    "Now, his clumsiness had suggested the use of the scissors, and the victim not only discovered the scission in his coat, but caught the thief with the implements of his art upon him.",
    "By a miracle of impudence Vaux escaped conviction, but he deserved the gallows for his want of principle, and not even sympathy could have let drop a tear, had justice seized her due.",
    "On the straight or on the cross the canons of art deserve respect; and a thief is great, not because he is a thief, but because, in filling his own pocket, he preserves from violence the legitimate traditions of his craft.",
    "But it was in conflict with the jewellers that Vaux best proved his mettle.",
    "It was his wont to clothe himself 'in the most elegant attire,' and on the pretence of purchase to rifle the shops of Piccadilly.",
    "For this offence-'pinching' the Cant Dictionary calls it-he did his longest stretch of time, and here his admirable qualities of cunning and coolness found their most generous scope.",
    "A love of fine clothes he shared with all the best of his kind, and he visited Mr Bilger-the jeweller who arrested him-magnificently arrayed.",
    "He wore a black coat and waistcoat, blue pantaloons, Hessian boots, and a hat 'in the extreme of the newest fashion.'",
    "He was also resplendent with gold watch and eye-glass.",
    "His hair was powdered, and a fawney sparkled on his dexter fam.",
    "The booty was enormous, and a week later he revisited the shop on another errand.",
    "This second visit was the one flash of genius in a somewhat drab career: the jeweller was so completely dumfounded, that Vaux might have got clean away.",
    "But though he kept discreetly out of sight for a while, at last he drifted back to his ancient boozing-ken, and was there betrayed to a notorious thief-catcher.",
    "The inevitable sentence of death followed.",
    "It was commuted after the fashion of the time, and Vaux, having sojourned a while at the Hulks, sought for a second time the genial airs of Botany Bay.",
    "His vanity and his laziness were alike invincible.",
    "He believed himself a miracle of learning as well as a perfect thief, and physical toil was the sole 'lay' for which he professed no capacity.",
    "For a while he corrected the press for a printer, and he roundly asserts that his knowledge of literature and of foreign tongues rendered him invaluable.",
    "It was vanity again that induced him to assert his innocence when he was lagged for so vulgar a crime as stealing a wipe from a tradesman in Chancery Lane.",
    "At the moment of arrest he was on his way to purchase base coin from a Whitechapel bit-faker: but, despite his nefarious errand, he is righteously wrathful at what he asserts was an unjust conviction, and henceforth he assumed the crown of martyrdom.",
    "His first and last ambition during the intervals of freedom was gentility, and so long as he was not at work he lived the life of a respectable grocer.",
    "Although the casual Cyprian flits across his page, he pursued the one flame of his life for the good motive, and he affects to be a very model of domesticity.",
    "The sentiment of piety also was strong upon him, and if he did not, like the illustrious Peace, pray for his jailer, he rivalled the Prison Ordinary in comforting the condemned.",
    "Had it only been his fate to die on the gallows, how unctuous had been his croak!",
    "The text of his 'Memoirs' having been edited, it is scarce possible to define his literary talent.",
    "The book, as it stands, is an excellent piece of narrative, but it loses somewhat by the pretence of style.",
    "The man's invulnerable conceit prevented an absolute frankness, and there is little enough hilarity to correct the acid sentiment and the intolerable vows of repentance.",
    "Again, though he knows his subject, and can patter flash with the best, his incorrigible respectability leads him to ape the manner of a Grub Street hack, and to banish to a vocabulary those pearls of slang which might have added vigour and lustre to his somewhat tiresome page.",
    "However, the thief cannot escape his inevitable defects.",
    "The vanity, the weakness, the sentimentality of those who are born beasts of prey, yet have the faculty of depredation only half-developed, are the foes of truth, and it is well to remember that the autobiography of a rascal is tainted at its source.",
    "A congenial pickpocket, equipped with the self-knowledge and the candour which would enable him to recognise himself an outlaw and justice his enemy rather than an instrument of malice, would prove a Napoleon rather than a Vaux.",
    "So that we must e'en accept our Newgate Calendar with its many faults upon its head, and be content.",
    "For it takes a man of genius to write a book, and the thief who turns author commonly inhabits a paradise of the second-rate.",
    "AS Captain Hind was master of the road, George Barrington was (and remains for ever) the absolute monarch of pickpockets.",
    "Though the art, superseding the cutting of purses, had been practised with courage and address for half a century before Barrington saw the light, it was his own incomparable genius that raised thievery from the dangerous valley of experiment, and set it, secure and honoured, upon the mountain height of perfection.",
    "To a natural habit of depredation, which, being a man of letters, he was wont to justify, he added a sureness of hand, a fertility of resource, a recklessness of courage which drove his contemporaries to an amazed respect, and from which none but the Philistine will withhold his admiration.",
    "An accident discovered his taste and talent.",
    "At school he attempted to kill a companion-the one act of violence which sullies a strangely gentle career; and outraged at the affront of a flogging, he fled with twelve guineas and a gold repeater watch.",
    "A vulgar theft this, and no presage of future greatness; yet it proves the fearless greed, the contempt of private property, which mark as with a stigma the temperament of the prig.",
    "His faculty did not rust long for lack of use, and at Drogheda, when he was but sixteen, he encountered one Price, half barnstormer, half thief.",
    "Forthwith he embraced the twin professions, and in the interlude of more serious pursuits is reported to have made a respectable appearance as Jaffier in Venice Preserved.",
    "For a while he dreamed of Drury Lane and glory; but an attachment for Miss Egerton, the Belvidera to his own Jaffier, was more costly than the barns of Londonderry warranted, and, with Price for a colleague, he set forth on a tour of robbery, merely interrupted through twenty years by a few periods of enforced leisure.",
    "His youth, indeed, was his golden age.",
    "For four years he practised his art, chilled by no shadow of suspicion, and his immunity was due as well to his excellent bearing as to his sleight of hand.",
    "In one of the countless chap-books which dishonour his fame, he is unjustly accused of relying for his effects upon an elaborate apparatus, half knife, half scissors, wherewith to rip the pockets of his victims.",
    "The mere backbiting of envy!",
    "An artistic triumph was never won save by legitimate means; and the hero who plundered the Dulce of L-r at Ranelagh, who emptied the pockets of his acquaintance without fear of exposure, who all but carried off the priceless snuff-box of Count Orloff, most assuredly followed his craft in full simplicity and with a proper scorn of clumsy artifice.",
    "At his first appearance he was the master, sumptuously apparelled, with Price for valet.",
    "At Dublin his birth and quality were never questioned, and when he made a descent upon London it was in company with Captain W. H-n, who remained for years his loyal friend.",
    "He visited Brighton as the chosen companion of Lord Ferrers and the wicked Lord Lyttelton.",
    "His manners and learning were alike irresistible.",
    "Though the picking of pockets was the art and interest of his life, he was on terms of easy familiarity with light literature, and he considered no toil too wearisome if only his conversation might dazzle his victims.",
    "Two maxims he charactered upon his heart: the one, never to run a large risk for a small gain; the other, never to forget the carriage and diction of a gentleman.",
    "He never stooped to pilfer, until exposure and decay had weakened his hand.",
    "In his first week at Dublin he carried off \u00a31000, and it was only his fateful interview with Sir John Fielding that gave him poverty for a bedfellow.",
    "Even at the end, when he slunk from town to town, a notorious outlaw, he had inspirations of his ancient magnificence, and-at Chester-he eluded the vigilance of his enemies and captured \u00a3600, wherewith he purchased some months of respectability.",
    "Now, respectability was ever dear to him, and it was at once his pleasure and profit to live in the highest society.",
    "Were it not blasphemy to sully Barrington with slang you would call him a member of the swell-mob, but, having cultivated a grave and sober style for himself, he recoiled in horror from the flash lingo, and his susceptibility demands respect.",
    "He kept a commonplace book!",
    "Was ever such thrift in a thief?",
    "Whatever images or thoughts flashed through his brain, he seized them on paper, even 'amidst the jollity of a tavern, or in the warmth of an interesting conversation.'",
    "Was it then strange that he triumphed as a man of fashionable and cultured leisure?",
    "He would visit Ranelagh with the most distinguished, and turn a while from epigram and jest to empty the pocket of a rich acquaintance.",
    "And ever with so tactful a certainty, with so fine a restraint of the emotions, that suspicion was preposterous.",
    "To catalogue his exploits is superfluous, yet let it be recorded that once he went to Court, habited as a clergyman, and came home the richer for a diamond order, Lord C-'s proudest decoration.",
    "Even the assault upon Prince Orloff was nobly planned.",
    "Barrington had precise intelligence of the marvellous snuff-box-the Empress's own gift to her lover; he knew also how he might meet the Prince at Drury Lane; he had even discovered that the Prince for safety hid the jewel in his vest.",
    "But the Prince felt the Prig's hand upon the treasure, and gave an instant alarm.",
    "Over-confidence, maybe, or a too liberal dinner was the cause of failure, and Barrington, surrounded in a moment, was speedily in the lock-up.",
    "It was the first rebuff that the hero had received, and straightway his tact and ingenuity left him.",
    "The evidence was faulty, the prosecution declined, and naught was necessary for escape save presence of mind.",
    "Even friends were staunch, and had Barrington told his customary lie, his character had gone unsullied.",
    "Yet having posed for his friends as a student of the law, at Bow Street he must needs declare himself a doctor, and the needless discrepancy ruined him.",
    "Though he escaped the gallows, there was an end to the diversions of intellect and fashion; as he discovered when he visited the House of Lords to hear an appeal, and Black Rod ejected him at the persuasion of Mr. G-.",
    "As yet unused to insult, he threatened violence against the aggressor, and finding no bail he was sent on his first imprisonment to the Bridewell in Tothill Fields.",
    "Rapid, indeed, was the descent.",
    "At the first grip of adversity, he forgot his cherished principles, and two years later the loftiest and most elegant gentlemen that ever picked a pocket was at the Hulks-for robbing a harlot at Drury Lane!",
    "Henceforth, his insolence and artistry declined, and, though to the last there were intervals of grandeur, he spent the better part of fifteen years in the commission of crimes, whose very littleness condemned them.",
    "At last an exile from St. James's and Ranelagh, he was forced into a society which still further degraded him.",
    "Hitherto he had shunned the society of professed thieves; in his golden youth he had scorned to shelter him in the flash kens, which were the natural harbours of pickpockets.",
    "But now, says his biographer, he began to seek evil company, and, the victim of his own fame, found safety only in obscene concealment.",
    "At the Hulks he recovered something of his dignity, and discretion rendered his first visit brief enough.",
    "Even when he was committed on a second offence, and had attempted suicide, he was still irresistible, and he was discharged with several years of imprisonment to run.",
    "But, in truth, he was born for honour and distinction, and common actions, common criminals, were in the end distasteful to him.",
    "In his heyday he stooped no further than to employ such fences as might profitably dispose of his booty, and the two partners of his misdeeds were both remarkable.",
    "James, the earlier accomplice affected clerical attire, and in 1791 'was living in a Westphalian monastery, to which he some years ago retired, in an enviable state of peace and penitence, respected for his talents, and loved for his amiable manners, by which he is distinguished in an eminent degree.'",
    "The other ruffian, Lowe by name, was known to his own Bloomsbury Square for a philanthropic and cultured gentleman, yet only suicide saved him from the gallows.",
    "And while Barrington was wise in the choice of his servants, his manners drove even strangers to admiration.",
    "Policemen and prisoners were alike anxious to do him honour.",
    "Once when he needed money for his own defence, his brother thieves, whom he had ever shunned and despised, collected \ufffd100 for the captain of their guild.",
    "Nor did gaoler and judge ever forget the respect due to a gentleman.",
    "When Barrington was tried and condemned for the theft of Mr. Townsend's watch at Enfield Races-September 15, 1790, was the day of his last transgression-one knows not which was the more eloquent in his respect, the judge or the culprit.",
    "But it was not until the pickpocket set out for Botany Bay that he took full advantage of his gentlemanly bearing.",
    "To thrust 'Mr.'",
    "Barrington into the hold was plainly impossible, even though transportation for seven years was his punishment.",
    "Wherefore he was admitted to the boatswain's mess, was allowed as much baggage as a first-class passenger, and doubtless beguiled the voyage (for others) with the information of a well-stored mind.",
    "By an inspiration of luck he checked a mutiny, holding the quarter-deck against a mob of ruffians with no weapon but a marline-spike.",
    "And hereafter, as he tells you in his 'Voyage to New South Wales,' he was accorded the fullest liberty to come or go.",
    "He visited many a foreign port with the officers of the ship; he packed a hundred note-books with trite and superfluous observations; he posed, in brief, as the captain of the ship without responsibility.",
    "Arrived at Port Jackson, he was acclaimed a hero, and received with obsequious solicitude by the Governor, who promised that his 'future situation should be such as would render his banishment from England as little irksome as possible.'",
    "Forthwith he was appointed high constable of Paramatta, and, like Vautrin, who might have taken the youthful Barrington for another Rastignac, he ended his days the honourable custodian of less fortunate convicts.",
    "Or, as a broadside ballad has it,                       He left old Drury's flash purlieus,  To turn at last a copper.",
    "Never did he revert to his ancient practice.",
    "If in his youth he had lived the double-life with an effrontery and elegance which Brodie himself never attained, henceforth his career was single in its innocence.",
    "He became a prig in the less harmful and more offensive sense.",
    "After the orthodox fashion he endeared himself to all who knew him, and ruled Paramatta with an equable severity.",
    "Having cultivated the humanities for the base purposes of his trade, he now devoted himself to literature with an energy of dulness, becoming, as it were, a liberal education personified.",
    "His earlier efforts had been in verse, and you wonder that no enterprising publisher had ventured on a limited edition.",
    "Time was he composed an ode to Light, and once recovering from a fever contracted at Ballyshannon, he addressed a few burning lines to Hygeia:                       Hygeia!",
    "thou whose eyes display  The lustre of meridian day;   and so on for endless couplets.",
    "Then, had he not celebrated in immortal verse his love for Miss Egerton, untimely drowned in the waters of the Boyne?",
    "But now, as became the Constable of Paramatta, he chose the sterner medium, and followed up his 'Voyage to New South Wales' with several exceeding trite and valuable histories.",
    "His most ambitious work was dedicated in periods of unctuous piety to his Majesty King George III., and the book's first sentence is characteristic of his method and sensibility: 'In contemplating the origin, rise, and fall of nations, the mind is alternately filled with a mixture of sacred pain and pleasure.'",
    "Would you read further?",
    "Then you will find Fauna and Flora, twin goddesses of ineptitude, flitting across the page, unreadable as a geographical treatise.",
    "His first masterpiece was translated into French, anno VI., and the translator apologises that war with England alone prevents the compilation of a suitable biography.",
    "Was ever thief treated with so grave a consideration?",
    "Then another work was prefaced by the Right Hon.",
    "William Eden, and all were 'embellished with beautiful coloured plates,' and ran through several editions.",
    "Once only did he return to poetry, the favoured medium of his youth, and he returned to write an imperishable line.",
    "Even then his pedantry persuaded him to renounce the authorship, and to disparage the achievement.",
    "The occasion was the opening of a theatre at Sydney, wherein the parts were sustained by convicts.",
    "The cost of admission to the gallery was one shilling, paid in money, flour, meat, or spirits.",
    "The play was entitled The Revenge and the Hotel, and Barrington provided the prologue, which for one passage is for ever memorable.",
    "Thus it runs:                       From distant climes, o'er widespread seas, we come,  Though not with much eclat or beat of drum;  True patriots we, for be it understood,  We left our country for our country's good.",
    "No private views disgraced our generous zeal,  What urged our travels was our country's weal;  And none will doubt, but that our emigration  Has proved most useful to the British nation.",
    "'We left our country for our country's good.'",
    "That line, thrown fortuitously into four hundred pages of solid prose, has emerged to become the common possession of Fleet Street.",
    "It is the man's one title to literary fame, for spurning the thievish practice he knew so well, he was righteously indignant when The London Spy was fathered upon him.",
    "Though he emptied his contemporary's pockets of many thousands, he enriched the Dictionary of Quotations with one line, which will be repeated so long as there is human hand to wield a pen.",
    "And, if the High Constable of Paramatta was tediously respectable, George Barrington, the Prig, was a man of genius.",
    "DAVID HAGGART was born at Canonmills, with no richer birthright than thievish fingers and a left hand of surpassing activity.",
    "The son of a gamekeeper, he grew up a long-legged, red-headed callant, lurking in the sombre shadow of the Cowgate, or like the young Sir Walter, championing the Auld Town against the New on the slopes of Arthur's Seat.",
    "Kipping was his early sin; but the sportsman's instinct, born of his father's trade, was so strong within him, that he pinched a fighting cock before he was breeched, and risked the noose for horse-stealing when marbles should have engrossed his boyish fancy.",
    "Turbulent and lawless, he bitterly resented the intolerable restraint of a tranquil life, and, at last, in the hope of a larger liberty, he enlisted for a drummer in the Norfolk Militia, stationed at the moment in Edinburgh Castle.",
    "A brief, insubordinate year, misspent in his country's service, proved him hopeless of discipline: he claimed his discharge, and henceforth he was free to follow the one craft for which nature and his own ambition had moulded him.",
    "Like Chatterton, like Rimbaud, Haggart came into the full possession of his talent while still a child.",
    "A Barrington of fourteen, he knew every turn and twist of his craft, before he escaped from school.",
    "His youthful necessities were munificently supplied by facile depredation, and the only hindrance to immediate riches was his ignorance of flash kens where he might fence his plunder.",
    "Meanwhile he painted his soul black with wickedness.",
    "Such hours as he could snatch from the profitable conduct of his trade he devoted to the austere debauchery of Leith or the Golden Acre.",
    "Though he knew not the seduction of whisky, he missed never a dance nor a raffle, joining the frolics of prigs and callets in complete forgetfulness of the shorter catechism.",
    "In vain the kirk compared him to a 'bottle in the smoke'; in vain the minister whispered of hell and the gallows; his heart hardened, as his fingers grew agile, and when, at sixteen, he left his father's house for a sporting life, he had not his equal in the three kingdoms for cunning and courage.",
    "His first accomplice was Barney M'Guire, who-until a fourteen stretch sent him to Botany Bay-played Clytus to David's Alexander, and it was at Portobello Races that their brilliant partnership began.",
    "Hitherto Haggart had worked by stealth; he had tracked his booty under the cloud of night.",
    "Now was the moment to prove his prowess in the eye of day, to break with a past which he already deemed ignoble.",
    "His heart leaped with the occasion: he tackled his adventure with the hot-head energy of a new member, big with his maiden speech.",
    "The victim was chosen in an instant: a backer, whose good fortune had broken the bookmakers.",
    "There was no thief on the course who did not wait, in hungry appetence, the sportsman's descent from the stand; yet the novice outstripped them all.",
    "'I got the first dive at his keek-cloy,' he writes in his simple, heroic style, 'and was so eager on my prey, that I pulled out the pocket along with the money, and nearly upset the gentleman.'",
    "A steady brain saved him from the consequence of an o'erbuoyant enthusiasm.",
    "The notes were passed to Barney in a flash, and when the sportsman turned upon his assailant, Haggart's hands were empty.",
    "Thereupon followed an infinite series of brilliant exploits.",
    "With Barney to aid, he plundered the Border like a reiver.",
    "He stripped the yeomen of Tweedside with a ferocity which should have avenged the disgrace of Flodden.",
    "More than once he ransacked Ecclefechan, though it is unlikely that he emptied the lean pocket of Thomas Carlyle.",
    "There was not a gaff from Newcastle to the Tay which he did not haunt with sedulous perseverance; nor was he confronted with failure, until his figure became a universal terror.",
    "His common method was to price a horse, and while the dealer showed Barney the animal's teeth, Haggart would slip under the uplifted arm, and ease the blockhead of his blunt.",
    "Arrogant in his skill, delighted with his manifold triumphs, Haggart led a life of unbroken prosperity under the brisk air of heaven, and, despite the risk of his profession, he remained two years a stranger to poverty and imprisonment.",
    "His worst mishap was to slip his forks into an empty pocket, or to encounter in his cups a milvadering horse-dealer; but his joys were free and frank, while he exulted in his success with a boyish glee.",
    "'I was never happier in all my life than when I fingered all this money,' he exclaims when he had captured the comfortable prize of two hundred pounds.",
    "And then he would make merry at Newcastle or York, forgetting the knowing ones for a while, going abroad in white cape and tops, and flicking his leg like a gentleman with a dandy whip.",
    "But at last Barney and a wayward ambition persuaded him to desert his proper craft for the greater hazard of cracking a crib, and thus he was involved in his ultimate ruin.",
    "He incurred and he deserved the untoward fate of those who overlook their talents' limitation; and when this master of pickpockets followed Barney through the window of a secluded house upon the York Road, he might already have felt the noose tightening at his neck.",
    "The immediate reward of this bungled attack was thirty pounds, but two days later he was committed with Barney to the Durham Assizes, where he exchanged the obscurity of the perfect craftsman for the notoriety of the dangerous gaol-bird.",
    "For the moment, however, he recovered his freedom: breaking prison, he straightway conveyed a fiddlestick to his comrade, and in a twinkling was at Newcastle again, picking up purses well lined with gold, and robbing the bumpkins of their scouts and chats.",
    "But the time of security was overpast.",
    "Marked and suspicious, he began to fear the solitude of the country; he left the horse-fair for the city, and sought in the budging-kens of Edinburgh the secrecy impossible on the hill-side.",
    "A clumsy experiment in shop-lifting doubled his danger, and more than once he saw the inside of the police-office.",
    "Henceforth, he was free of the family; he loafed in the Shirra-Brae; he knew the flash houses of Leith and the Grassmarket.",
    "With Jean Johnston, the blowen of his choice, he smeared his hands with the squalor of petty theft, and the drunken recklessness wherewith he swaggered it abroad hastened his approaching downfall.",
    "With a perpetual anxiety to avoid the nippers his artistry dwindled.",
    "The left hand, invincible on the Cheviots, seemed no better than a bunch of thumbs in the narrow ways of Edinburgh; and after innumerable misadventures Haggart was safely lodged in Dumfries gaol.",
    "No sooner was he locked within his cell than his restless brain planned a generous escape.",
    "He would win liberty for his fellows as well as for himself, and after a brief council a murderous plot was framed and executed.",
    "A stone slung in a handkerchief sent Morrin, the gaoler, to sleep; the keys found on him opened the massy doors; and Haggart was free with a reward set upon his head.",
    "The shock of the enterprise restored his magnanimity.",
    "Never did he display a finer bravery than in this spirited race for his life, and though three counties were aroused he doubled and ducked to such purpose that he outstripped John Richardson himself with all his bloodhounds, and two days later marched into Carlisle disguised in the stolen rags of a potato-bogle.",
    "During the few months that remained to him of life he embarked upon a veritable Odyssey: he scoured Scotland from the Border to St. Andrews, and finally contrived a journey oversea to Ireland, where he made the name of Daniel O'Brien a terror to well-doers.",
    "Insolent and careless, he lurched from prison to prison; now it was Armagh that held him, now Downpatrick, until at last he was thrust on a general charge of vagabondage and ill-company into Kilmainham, which has since harboured many a less valiant adventurer than David Haggart.",
    "Here the culminating disgrace overtook him: he was detected in the prison yard by his ancient enemy, John Richardson, of Dumfries, who dragged him back to Scotland heavily shackled and charged with murder.",
    "So nimble had he proved himself in extrication, that his captors secured him with pitiless severity; round his waist he carried an iron belt, whereto were padlocked the chains, clanking at his wrists and ankles.",
    "Thus tortured and helpless, he was fed 'like a sucking turkey in Bedlam'; but his sorrows vanished, and his dying courage revived at sight of the torchlight procession, which set forth from Dumfries to greet his return.",
    "His coach was hustled by a mob, thousands strong, eager to catch sight of Haggart the Murderer, and though the spot where he slew Morrin was like fire beneath his passing feet, he carried to his cell a heart and a brain aflame with gratified vanity.",
    "His guilt being patent, reprieve was as hopeless as acquittal, and after the assured condemnation he spent his last few days with what profit he might in religious and literary exercises.",
    "He composed a memoir, which is a model of its kind; so diligently did he make his soul, that he could appear on the scaffold in a chastened spirit of prayerful gratitude; and, being an eminent scoundrel, he seemed a proper subject for the ministrations of Mr. George Combe.",
    "'That is the one thing I did not know before,' he confessed with an engaging modesty, when his bumps were squeezed, and yet he was more than a match for the amiable phrenologist, whose ignorance of mankind persuaded him to believe that an illiterate felon could know himself and analyse his character.",
    "His character escaped his critics as it escaped himself.",
    "Time was when George Borrow, that other picaroon, surprised the youthful David, thinking of Willie Wallace upon the Castle Rock, and Lavengro's romantic memory transformed the raw-boned pickpocket into a monumental hero, who lacked nothing save a vast theatre to produce a vast effect.",
    "He was a Tamerlane, robbed of his opportunity; a valiant warrior, who looked in vain for a battlefield; a marauder who climbed the scaffold not for the magnitude, but for the littleness of his sins.",
    "Thus Borrow, in complete misunderstanding of the rascal's qualities.",
    "Now, Haggart's ambition was as circumscribed as his ability.",
    "He died, as he was born, an expert cly-faker, whose achievements in sleight of hand are as yet unparalleled.",
    "Had the world been one vast breast pocket his fish-hook fingers would have turned it inside out.",
    "But it was not his to mount a throne, or overthrow a dynasty.",
    "'My forks,' he boasted, 'are equally long, and they never fail me.'",
    "That is at once the reason and the justification of his triumph.",
    "Born with a consummate artistry tingling at his finger-tips, how should he escape the compulsion of a glorious destiny?",
    "Without fumbling or failure he discovered the single craft for which fortune had framed him, and he pursued it with a courage and an industry which gave him not a kingdom, but fame and booty, exceeding even his greedy aspiration.",
    "No Tamerlane he, questing for a continent, but David Haggart, the man with the long forks, happy if he snatched his neighbour's purse.",
    "Before all things he respected the profession which his left hand made inevitable, and which he pursued with unconquerable pride.",
    "Nor in his inspired youth was plunder his sole ambition: he cultivated the garden of his style with the natural zeal of the artist; he frowned upon the bungler with a lofty contempt.",
    "His materials were simplicity itself: his forks, which were always with him, and another's well-filled pocket, since, sensible of danger, he cared not to risk his neck for a purse that did not contain so much as would 'sweeten a grawler.'",
    "At its best, his method was always witty-that is the single word which will characterise it-witty as a piece of Heine's prose, and as dangerous.",
    "He would run over a man's pockets while he spoke with him, returning what he chose to discard without the lightest breath of suspicion.",
    "'A good workman,' his contemporaries called him; and they thought it a shame for him to be idle.",
    "Moreover, he did not blunder unconsciously upon his triumph; he tackled the trade in so fine a spirit of analysis that he might have been the very Aristotle of his science.",
    "'The keek-cloy,' he wrote, in his hints to young sportsmen, 'is easily picked.",
    "If the notes are in the long fold just tip them the forks; but if there is a purse or open money in the case, you must link it.'",
    "The breast-pocket, on the other hand, is a severer test.",
    "'Picking the suck is sometimes a kittle job,' again the philosopher speaks.",
    "'If the coat is buttoned it must be opened by slipping past.",
    "Then bring the lil down between the flap of the coat and the body, keeping your spare arm across your man's breast, and so slip it to a comrade; then abuse the fellow for jostling you.'",
    "Not only did he master the tradition of thievery; he vaunted his originality with the familiar complacence of the scoundrel.",
    "Forgetting that it was by burglary that he was undone, he explains for his public glorification that he was wont to enter the houses of Leith by forcing the small window above the outer door.",
    "This artifice, his vanity grumbles, is now common; but he would have all the world understand that it was his own invention, and he murmurs with the pedantry of the convicted criminal that it is now set forth for the better protection of honest citizens.",
    "No less admirable in his own eyes was that other artifice which induced him to conceal such notes as he managed to filch in the collar of his coat.",
    "Thus he eluded the vigilance of the police, which searched its prey in those days with a sorry lack of cunning.",
    "In truth, Haggart's wits were as nimble as his fingers, and he seldom failed to render a profitable account of his talents.",
    "He beguiled one of his sojourns in gaol by manufacturing tinder wherewith to light the prisoners' pipes, and it is not astonishing that he won a general popularity.",
    "In Ireland, when the constables would take him for a Scot, he answered in high Tipperary, and saved his skin for a while by a brogue which would not have shamed a modern patriot.",
    "But quick as were his wits, his vanity always outstripped them, and no hero ever bragged of his achievements with a louder effrontery.",
    "Now all you ramblers in mourning go,  For the prince of ramblers is lying low,  And all you maidens that love the game,  Put on your mourning veils again.",
    "Thus he celebrated his downfall in a ballad that has the true Newgate ring, and verily in his own eyes he was a hero who carried to the scaffold a dauntless spirit unstained by treachery.",
    "He believed himself an adept in all the arts; as a squire of dames he held himself peerless, and he assured the ineffable Combe, who recorded his flippant utterance with a credulous respect, that he had sacrificed hecatombs of innocent virgins to his importunate lust.",
    "Prose and verse trickled with equal facility from his pen, and his biography is a masterpiece.",
    "Written in the pedlar's French as it was misspoken in the hells of Edinburgh, it is a narrative of uncommon simplicity and directness, marred now and again by such superfluous reflections as are the natural result of thievish sentimentality.",
    "He tells his tale without paraphrase or adornment, and the worthy Writer to the Signet, who prepared the work for the Press, would have asked three times the space to record one-half the adventures.",
    "'I sunk upon it with my forks and brought it with me'; 'We obtained thirty-three pounds by this affair'-is there not the stalwart flavour of the epic in these plain, unvarnished sentences?",
    "His other accomplishments are pallid in the light of his brilliant left hand.",
    "Once, at Derry-he attended a cock-fight, and beguiled an interval by emptying the pockets of a lucky bookmaker.",
    "An expert, who watched the exploit in admiration, could not withhold a compliment.",
    "'You are the Switcher,' he exclaimed; 'some take all, but you leave nothing.'",
    "And it is as the Switcher that Haggart keeps his memory green.",
    "'DAMN ye both!",
    "stop, or I will blow your brains out!'",
    "Thus it was that Harry Simms greeted his victims, proving in a phrase that the heroic age of the rumpad was no more.",
    "Forgotten the debonair courtesy of Claude Duval!",
    "Forgotten the lightning wit, the swift repartee of the incomparable Hind!",
    "No longer was the hightoby-gloak a 'gentleman' of the road; he was a butcher, if not a beggar, on horseback; a braggart without the courage to pull a trigger; a swashbuckler, oblivious of that ancient style which converted the misery of surrender into a privilege.",
    "Yet Harry Simms, the supreme adventurer of his age, was not without distinction; his lithe form and his hard-ridden horse were the common dread of England; his activity was rewarded with a princely treasure; and if his method were lacking in urbanity, the excuse is that he danced not to the brilliant measure of the Cavaliers, but limped to the clumsy fiddle-scraping of the early Georges.",
    "At Eton, where a too-indulgent grandmother had placed him, he ransacked the desks of his school-fellows, and avenged a birching by emptying his master's pockets.",
    "Wherefore he lost the hope of a polite education, and instead of proceeding with a clerkly dignity to King's College, in the University of Cambridge, he was ignominiously apprenticed to a breeches-maker.",
    "The one restraint was as irksome as the other, and Harry Simms abandoned the needle, as he had scorned the grammar, to go upon the pad.",
    "Though his early companions were scragged at Tyburn, the light-fingered rascal was indifferent to their fate, and squandering such booty as fell to his share, he bravely 'turned out' for more.",
    "Tottenham Court Fair was the theatre of his childish exploits, and there he gained some little skill in the picking of pockets.",
    "But a spell of bad trade brought him to poverty, and he attempted to replenish an empty pocket by the childish expedient of a threatening letter.",
    "The plan was conceived and executed with a futility which ensured an instant capture.",
    "The bungler chose a stranger at haphazard, commanding him, under penalty of death, to lay five guineas upon a gun in Tower Wharf; the guineas were cunningly deposited, and the rascal, caught with his hand upon the booty, was committed to Newgate.",
    "Youth, and the intercession of his grandmother, procured a release, unjustified by the infamous stupidity of the trick.",
    "Its very clumsiness should have sent him over sea; and it is wonderful that from a beginning of so little promise, he should have climbed even the first slopes of greatness.",
    "However, the memory of gaol forced him to a brief interlude of honesty; for a while he wore the pink coat of Colonel Cunningham's postillion, and presently was promoted to the independence of a hackney coach.",
    "Thus employed, he became acquainted with the famous Cyprians of Covent Garden, who, loving him for his handsome face and sprightly gesture, seduced him to desert his cab for an easier profession.",
    "So long as the sky was fair, he lived under their amiable protection; but the summer having chased the smarter gentry from town, the ladies could afford him no more than would purchase a horse and a pair of pistols, so that Harry was compelled to challenge fortune on the high road.",
    "His first journey was triumphantly successful.",
    "A post-chaise and a couple of coaches emptied their wealth into his hands, and, riding for London, he was able to return the favours lavished upon him by Covent Garden.",
    "At the first touch of gold he was transformed to a finished blade.",
    "He purchased himself a silver-hilted sword, which he dangled over a discreet suit of black velvet; a prodigious run of luck at the gaming-tables kept his purse well lined; and he made so brilliant an appearance in his familiar haunts that he speedily gained the name of 'Gentleman Harry.'",
    "But the money, lightly won, was lightly spent.",
    "The tables took back more than they gave, and before long Simms was astride his horse again, flourishing his irons, and crying: 'Stand and deliver'!",
    "upon every road in England.",
    "Epping Forest was his general hunting-ground, but his enterprise took him far afield, and if one night he galloped by starlight across Bagshot Heath, another he was holding up the York stage with unbridled insolence.",
    "He robbed, he roared, he blustered with praiseworthy industry; and good luck coming to the aid of caution, he escaped for a while the necessary punishment of his crimes.",
    "It was on Stockbridge Downs that he met his first check.",
    "He had stopped a chariot, and came off with a hatful of gold, but the victims, impatient of disaster, raised the county, and Gentleman Harry was laid by the heels.",
    "Never at a loss, he condescended to a cringing hypocrisy: he whined, he whimpered, he babbled of reform, he plied his prosecutors with letters so packed with penitence, that they abandoned their case, and in a couple of days Simms had eased a collector at Eversey Bank of three hundred pounds.",
    "For this enterprise two others climbed the gallows, and the robber's pride in his capture was miserably lessened by the shedding of innocent blood.",
    "But he forgot his remorse as speedily as he dissipated his money, and sentimentality neither damped his enjoyment nor restrained his energy.",
    "Even his brief visits to London were turned to the best account; and, though he would have the world believe him a mere voluptuary, his eye was bent sternly upon business.",
    "If he did lose his money in a gambling hell, he knew who won it, and spoke with his opponent on the homeward way.",
    "In his eyes a fuddled rake was always fair game, and the stern windows of St. Clement's Church looked down upon many a profitable adventure.",
    "His most distinguished journey was to Ireland, whither he set forth to find a market for his stolen treasure.",
    "But he determined that the road should bear its own charges, and he reached Dublin a richer man than he left London.",
    "In three months he was penniless, but he did not begin trade again until he had recrossed the Channel, and, having got to work near Chester, he returned to the Piazza fat with bank-notes.",
    "With success his extravagance increased, and, living the life of a man about town, he was soon harassed by debt.",
    "More than once he was lodged in the Marshalsea, and as his violent temper resented the interference of a dun, he became notorious for his assaults upon sheriff's officers.",
    "And thus his poor skill grew poorer: forgetting his trade, he expected that brandy would ease his embarrassment.",
    "At last, sodden with drink, he enlisted in the Guards, from which regiment he deserted, only to be pressed aboard a man-of-war.",
    "Freed by a clever trick, he took to the road again, until a paltry theft from a barber transported him to Maryland.",
    "There he turned sailor, and his ship, The Two Sisters, being taken by a privateer, he contrived to scramble into Portugal, whence he made his way back to England, and to the only adventure of which he was master.",
    "He landed with no more money than the price of a pistol, but he prigged a prancer at Bristol horsefair, and set out upon his last journey.",
    "The tide of his fortune was at flood.",
    "He crammed his pockets with watches; he was owner of enough diamonds to set up shop in a fashionable quarter; of guineas he had as many as would support his magnificence for half a year; and at last he resolved to quit the road, and to live like the gentleman he was.",
    "To this prudence he was the more easily persuaded, because not only were the thief-takers eager for his capture, but he was a double-dyed deserter, whose sole chance of quietude was a decent obscurity.",
    "His resolution was taken at St. Albans, and over a comfortable dinner he pictured a serene and uneventful future.",
    "On the morrow he would set forth to Dublin, sell his handsome stock of jewels, and forget that the cart ever lumbered up Tyburn Hill.",
    "So elated was he with his growing virtue, that he called for a second bottle, and as the port heated his blood his fingers tingled for action.",
    "A third bottle proved beyond dispute that only the craven were idle; 'and why,' he exclaimed, generous with wine, 'should the most industrious ruffler of England condescend to inaction?'",
    "Instantly he summoned the ostler, screaming for his horse, and before Redburn he had emptied four pockets, and had exchanged his own tired jade for a fresh and willing beast.",
    "Still exultant in his contempt of cowardice, he faced the Warrington stage, and made off with his plunder at a drunken gallop.",
    "Arrived at Dunstable, he was so befogged with liquor and pride, that he entered the 'Bull Inn,' the goal of the very coach he had just encountered.",
    "He had scarce called for a quartern of brandy when the robbed passengers thronged into the kitchen; and the fright gave him enough sobriety to leave his glass untasted, and stagger to his horse.",
    "In a wild fury of arrogance and terror, of conflicting vice and virtue, he pressed on to Hockcliffe, where he took refuge from the rain, and presently, fuddled with more brandy, he fell asleep over the kitchen fire.",
    "By this time the hue and cry was raised; and as the hero lay helpless in the corner three troopers burst into the inn, levelled their pistols at his head, and threatened death if he put his hand to his pocket.",
    "Half asleep, and wholly drunk, he made not he smallest show of resistance; he surrendered all his money, watches, and diamonds, save a little that was sewn into his neckcloth, and sulkily crawled up to his bed-chamber.",
    "Thither the troopers followed him, and having restored some nine pounds at his urgent demand, they watched his heavy slumbers.",
    "For all his brandy Simms slept but uneasily, and awoke in the night sick with the remorse which is bred of ruined plans and a splitting head.",
    "He got up wearily, and sat over the fire 'a good deal chagrined,' to quote his own simple phrase, at his miserable capture.",
    "Escape seemed hopeless indeed; there crouched the vigilant troopers, scowling on their prey.",
    "A thousand plans chased each other through the hero's fuddled brain, and at last he resolved to tempt the cupidity of his guardians, and to make himself master of their fire-arms.",
    "There were still left him a couple of seals, one gold, the other silver, and watching his opportunity, Simms flung them with a flourish in the fire.",
    "It fell out as he expected; the hungry troopers made a dash to save the trinkets; the prisoner seized a brace of pistols and leapt to the door.",
    "But, alas, the pistols missed fire, Harry was immediately overpowered, and on the morrow was carried, sick and sorry, before the Justice.",
    "From Dunstable he travelled his last journey to Newgate, and, being condemned at the Old Bailey, he was hanged till he was dead, and his body thereafter was carried for dissection to a surgeon's in that same Covent Garden where he first deserted his hackney cab for the pleasures of the town.",
    "'Gentleman Harry' was neither a brilliant thief nor a courteous highwayman.",
    "There was no touch of the grand manner even in his prettiest achievement.",
    "His predecessors had made a pistol and a vizard an overwhelming terror, and he did but profit by their tradition when he bade the cowed traveller stand and deliver.",
    "His profession, as he practised it, neither demanded skill nor incurred danger.",
    "Though he threatened death at every encounter, you never hear that he pulled a trigger throughout his career.",
    "If his opponent jeered and rode off, he rode off with a whole skin and a full pocket.",
    "Once even this renowned adventurer accepted the cut of a riding-whip across his face, nor made any attempt to avenge the insult.",
    "But his manifold shortcomings were no hindrance to his success.",
    "Wherever he went, between London and York, he stopped coaches and levied his tax.",
    "A threatening voice, an arched eyebrow, an arrogant method of fingering an unloaded pistol, conspired with the craven, indolent habit of the time to make his every journey a procession of triumph.",
    "He was capable of performing all such feats as the age required of him.",
    "But you miss the spirit, the bravery, the urbanity, and the wit, which made the adventurer of the seventeenth century a figure of romance.",
    "One point only of the great tradition did Harry Simms remember.",
    "He was never unwilling to restore a trinket made precious by sentiment.",
    "Once when he took a gold ring from a gentleman's finger a gentlewoman burst into tears, exclaiming, 'There goes your father's ring.'",
    "Whereupon Simms threw all his booty into a hat, saying, 'For God's sake, take that or anything else you please.'",
    "In all other respects he was a bully, with the hesitancy of a coward, rather than the proper rival of Hind or Duval.",
    "Apart from the exercise of his trade, he was a very Mohock for brutality.",
    "He would ill-treat his victims, whenever their drunkenness permitted the freedom, and he had no better gifts for the women who were kind to him than cruelty and neglect.",
    "One of his many imprisonments was the result of a monstrous ferocity.",
    "'Unluckily in a quarrel,' he tells you gravely, 'I ran a crab-stick into a woman's eye'; and well did he deserve his sojourn in the New Prison.",
    "At another time he rewarded the keeper of a coffee-house, who supported him for six months, by stealing her watch; and, when she grumbled at his insolence, he reflected, with a chuckle, that she could more easily bear the loss of her watch than the loss of her lover.",
    "Even in his gaiety there was an unpleasant spice of greed and truculence.",
    "Once, when he was still seen in fashionable company, he went to a masquerade, dressed in a rich Spanish habit, lent him by a Captain in the Guards, and he made so fine a show that he captivated a young and beautiful Cyprian, whom, when she would have treated him with generosity, he did but reward with the loss of all her jewels.",
    "Moreover, he had so small a regard for his craft, that he would spoil his effects by drink or debauchery; and, though a highwayman, he cared so little for style, that he would as lief trick a drunken gamester as face his man on Bagshot Heath or beneath the shade of Epping Forest.",
    "You admire not his success, because, like the success of the popular politician, it depended rather upon his dupes than upon his merit.",
    "You approve not his raffish exploits in the hells of Covent Garden or Drury Lane.",
    "But you cannot withhold respect from his consistent dandyism, and you are grateful for the record that, engaged in a mean enterprise, he was dressed 'in a green velvet frock and a short lac'd waistcoat.'",
    "Above all, his picturesque capture at Hockcliffe atones for much stupidity.",
    "The resolution, wavering at the wine glass, the last drunken ride from St. Albans-these are inventions in experience, which should make Simms immortal.",
    "And when he sits 'by the fireside a good deal chagrined,' he recalls the arrest of a far greater man-even of Cartouche, who was surprised by the soldiers at his bedside stitching a torn pair of breeches.",
    "His autobiography, wherein 'he relates the truth as a dying man,' seemed excellent in the eyes of Borrow, who loved it so well that he imagined a sentence, ascribed it falsely to Simms, and then rewarded it with extravagant applause.",
    "But Gentleman Harry knew how to tell a simple story, and the book, 'all wrote by myself while under sentence of death,' is his best performance.",
    "In action he had many faults, for, if he was a highwayman among rakes, he was but a rake among highwaymen.",
    "HAGGART and Simms are united in the praise of Borrow, and in the generous applause of posterity.",
    "Each resumes for his own generation the prowess of his kind.",
    "Each has assured his immortality by an experiment in literature; and if epic simplicity and rapid narrative are the virtues of biography, it is difficult to award the prize.",
    "The Switcher preferred to write in the rough lingo, wherein he best expressed himself.",
    "He packs his pages with ill-spelt slang, telling his story of thievery in the true language of thieves.",
    "Gentleman Harry, as became a person of quality, mimicked the dialect wherewith he was familiar in the more fashionable gambling-dens of Covent Garden.",
    "Both write with out the smallest suggestion of false shame or idle regret, and a natural vanity lifts each of them out of the pit of commonplace on to the tableland of the heroic.",
    "They set forth their depredation, as a victorious general might record his triumphs, and they excel the nimblest Ordinary that ever penned a dying speech in all the gifts of the historian.",
    "But when you leave the study for the field, the Switcher instantly declares his superiority.",
    "He had the happiness to practise his craft in its heyday, while Simms knew but the fag-end of a noble tradition.",
    "Haggart, moreover, was an expert, pursuing a difficult art, while Simms was a bully, plundering his betters by bluff.",
    "Simms boasted no quality which might be set off against the accurate delicacy of Haggart's hand.",
    "The Englishman grew rich upon a rolling eye and a rusty pistol.",
    "He put on his 'fiercest manner,' and believed that the world would deny him nothing.",
    "The Scot, rejoicing in his exquisite skill, went to work without fuss or bluster, and added the joy of artistic pride to his delight in plunder.",
    "Though Simm's manner seems the more chivalrous, it required not one tithe of the courage which was Haggart's necessity.",
    "On horseback, with the semblance of a fire-arm, a man may easily challenge a coachful of women.",
    "It needs a cool brain and a sound courage to empty a pocket in the watchful presence of spies and policemen.",
    "While Gentleman Harry chose a lonely road, or the cover of night for his exploits, the Switcher always worked by day, hustled by a crowd of witnesses.",
    "Their hours of leisure furnish a yet more striking contrast.",
    "Simms was a polished dandy delighting in his clothes, unhappy if he were deprived of his bottle and his game.",
    "Haggart, on the other hand, was before all things sealed to his profession.",
    "He would have deserted the gayest masquerade, had he ever strayed into so light a frivolity, for the chance of lightening a pocket.",
    "He tasted but few amusements without the limits of his craft, and he preserved unto the end a touch of that dour character which is the heritage of his race.",
    "But, withal, he was an amiable decent body, who would have recoiled in horror from the drunken brutality of Gentleman Harry.",
    "Though he bragged to George Combe of his pitiless undoing of wenches, he never thrust a crab-stick into a woman's eye, and he was incapable of rewarding a kindness by robbery and neglect.",
    "Once-at Newcastle-he arrayed himself in a smart white coat and tops, but the splendour ill became his red-headed awkwardness, and he would have stood aghast at the satin frocks and velvet waistcoats of him who broke the hearts of Drury Lane.",
    "But if he were gentler in his life, Haggart was prepared to fight with a more reckless courage when his trade demanded it.",
    "It was the Gentleman's boast that he never shed the blood of man.",
    "When David found a turnkey between himself and freedom, he did not hesitate to kill, though his remorse was bitter enough when he neared the gallows.",
    "In brief, Haggart was not only the better craftsman, but the honester fellow, and though his hands were red with blood, he deserved his death far less than did the more truculent, less valiant Simms.",
    "Each had in his brain the stuff whereof men of letters are made: this is their parallel.",
    "And, by way of contrast, while the Switcher was an accomplished artist, Gentleman Harry was a roystering braggart.",
    "AS William Brodie stood at the bar, on trial for a his life, he seemed the gallantest gentleman in court.",
    "Thither he had been carried in a chair, and, still conscious of the honour paid him, he flashed a condescending smile upon his judges.",
    "His step was jaunty as ever; his superb attire well became the Deacon of a Guild.",
    "His coat was blue, his vest a very garden of flowers; while his satin breeches and his stockings of white silk were splendid in their simplicity.",
    "Beneath a cocked hat his hair was fully dressed and powdered, and even the prosecuting counsel assailed him with the respect due to a man of fashion.",
    "The fellow's magnificence was thrown into relief by the squalor of his accomplice.",
    "For George Smith had neither the money nor the taste to disguise himself as a polished rogue, and he huddled as far from his master as he could in the rags of his mean estate.",
    "Nor from this moment did Brodie ever abate one jot of his dignity.",
    "He faced his accusers with a clear eye and a frigid amiability; he listened to his sentence with a calm contempt; he laughed complacently at the sorry interludes of judicial wit; and he faced the last music with a bravery and a cynicism which bore the stamp of true greatness.",
    "It was not until after his crime that Brodie's heroism approved itself.",
    "And even then his was a triumph not of skill but of character.",
    "Always a gentleman in manner and conduct, he owed the success and the failure of his life to this one quality.",
    "When in flight he made for Flushing on board the Endeavour, the other passengers, who knew not his name, straightway christened him 'the gentleman.'",
    "The enterprise itself would have been impossible to one less persuasively gifted, and its proper execution is a tribute to the lofty quality of his mind.",
    "There was he in London, a stranger and a fugitive; yet instead of crawling furtively into a coal-barge he charters a ship, captures the confidence of the captain, carries the other passengers to Flushing, when they were bound for Leith, and compels every one to confess his charm!",
    "The thief, also, found him irresistible; and while the game lasted, the flash kens of Edinburgh murmured the Deacon's name in the hushed whisper of respect.",
    "His fine temperament disarmed treachery.",
    "In London he visited an ancient doxy of his own, who, with her bully, shielded him from justice, though betrayal would have met with an ample reward.",
    "Smith, if he knew himself the superior craftsman, trembled at the Deacon's nod, who thus swaggered it through life, with none to withhold the exacted reverence.",
    "To this same personal compulsion he owed his worldly advancement.",
    "Deacon of the Wrights' Guild while still a young man, he served upon the Council, was known for one of Edinburgh's honoured citizens, and never went abroad unmarked by the finger of respectful envy.",
    "He was elected in 1773 a member of the Cape Club, and met at the Isle of Man Arms in Craig's Close the wittiest men of his time and town.",
    "Raeburn, Runciman, and Ferguson the poet were of the society, and it was with such as these that Brodie might have wasted his vacant hour.",
    "Indeed, at the very moment that he was cracking cribs and shaking the ivories, he was a chosen leader of fashion and gaiety; and it was the elegance of the 'gentleman' that distinguished him from his fellows.",
    "The fop, indeed, had climbed the altitudes of life; the cracksman still stumbled in the valleys.",
    "If he had a ready cunning in the planning of an enterprise, he must needs bungle at the execution; and had he not been associated with George Smith, a king of scoundrels, there would be few exploits to record.",
    "And yet for the craft of housebreaker he had one solid advantage: he knew the locks and bolts of Edinburgh as he knew his primer-for had he not fashioned the most of them himself?",
    "But, his knowledge once imparted to his accomplices, he cheerfully sank to a menial's office.",
    "In no job did he play a principal's part: he was merely told off by Smith or another to guard the entrance and sound the alarm.",
    "When M'Kain's on the Bridge was broken, the Deacon found the false keys; it was Smith who carried off such poor booty as was found.",
    "And though the master suggested the attack upon Bruce's shop, knowing full well the simplicity of the lock, he lingered at the Vintner's over a game of hazard, and let the man pouch a sumptuous booty.",
    "Even the onslaught upon the Excise Office, which cost his life, was contrived with appalling clumsiness.",
    "The Deacon of the Wrights' Guild, who could slash wood at his will, who knew the artifice of every lock in the city, let his men go to work with no better implements than the stolen coulter of a plough and a pair of spurs.",
    "And when they tackled the ill omened job, Brodie was of those who brought failure upon it.",
    "Long had they watched the door of the Excise; long had they studied the habits of its clerks; so that they went to work in no vain spirit of experiment.",
    "Nor on the fatal night did they force an entrance until they had dogged the porter to his home.",
    "Smith and Brown ransacked the place for money, while Brodie and Andrew Ainslie remained without to give a necessary warning.",
    "Whereupon Ainslie was seized with fright, and Brodie, losing his head, called off the others, so that six hundred pounds were left, that might have been an easy prey.",
    "Smith, indignant at the collapse of the long-pondered design, laid the blame upon his master, and they swung, as Brodie's grim spirit of farce suggested, for four pounds apiece.",
    "The humours of the situation were all the Deacon's own.",
    "He dressed the part in black; his respectability grinned behind a vizard; and all the while he trifled nonchalantly with a pistol.",
    "Breaking the silence with snatches from The Beggar's Opera, he promised that all their lead should turn to gold, christened the coulter and the crow the Great and Little Samuel, and then went off to drink and dice at the Vintner's.",
    "How could anger prevail against this undying gaiety?",
    "And if Smith were peevish at failure, he was presently reconciled, and prepared once more to die for his Deacon.",
    "Even after escape, the amateur is still apparent.",
    "True, he managed the trip to Flushing with his ancient extravagance; true, he employed all the juggleries of the law to prevent his surrender at Amsterdam.",
    "But he knew not the caution of the born criminal, and he was run to earth, because he would still write to his friends like a gentleman.",
    "His letters, during this nightmare of disaster, are perfect in their carelessness and good-fellowship.",
    "In this he demands news of his children, as becomes a father and a citizen, and furnishes a schedule of their education; in that he is curious concerning the issue of a main, and would know whether his black cock came off triumphant.",
    "Nor, even in flight, did he forget his proper craft, but would have his tools sent to Charleston, that in America he might resume the trade that had made him Deacon.",
    "But his was the art of conduct, not of guile, and he deserved capture for his rare indifference.",
    "Why, then, with no natural impulsion, did he risk the gallows?",
    "Why, being no born thief, and innocent of the thief's cunning, did he associate with so clever a scoundrel as George Smith, with cowards craven as Brown and Ainslie?",
    "The greed of gold, doubtless, half persuaded him, but gold was otherwise attainable, and the motive was assuredly far more subtle.",
    "Brodie, in fact, was of a romantic turn.",
    "He was, so to say, a glorified schoolboy, surfeited with penny dreadfuls.",
    "He loved above all things to patter the flash, to dream himself another Macheath, to trick himself out with all the trappings of a crime he was unfit to commit.",
    "It was never the job itself that attracted him: he would always rather throw the dice than force a neighbour's window.",
    "But he must needs have a distraction from the respectability of his life.",
    "Everybody was at his feet; he was Deacon of his Guild, at an age whereat his fellows were striving to earn a reputable living; his masterpieces were fashioned, and the wrights' trade was already a burden.",
    "To go upon the cross seemed a dream of freedom, until he snapped his fingers at the world, filled his mouth with slang, prepared his alibi, and furnished him a whole wardrobe of disguises.",
    "With a conscious irony, maybe, he buried his pistols beneath the domestic hearth, jammed his dark lantern into the press, where he kept his game-cocks, and determined to make an inextricable jumble of his career.",
    "Drink is sometimes a sufficient reaction against the orderliness of a successful life.",
    "But drink and cards failed with the Deacon, and at the Vintner's of his frequentation he encountered accomplices proper for his schemes.",
    "Never was so outrageous a protest offered against domesticity.",
    "Yet Brodie's resolution was romantic after its fashion, and was far more respectable than the blackguardism of the French Revolution, which distracted housewifely discontent a year after the Deacon swung.",
    "Moreover, it gave occasion for his dandyism and his love of display.",
    "If in one incarnation he was the complete gentleman, in another he dressed the part of the perfect scoundrel, and the list of his costumes would have filled one of his own ledgers.",
    "But, when once the possibility of housebreaking was taken from him, he returned to his familiar dignity.",
    "Being questioned by the Procurator Fiscal, he shrugged his shoulders, regretting that other affairs demanded his attention.",
    "As who should say: it is unpardonable to disturb the meditations of a gentleman.",
    "He made a will bequeathing his knowledge of law to the magistrates of Edinburgh, his dexterity in cards and dice to Hamilton the chimney-sweeper, and all his bad qualities to his good friends and old companions, Brown and Ainslie, not doubting, however, that their own will secure them 'a rope at last.'",
    "In prison it was his worst complaint that, though the nails of his toes and fingers were not quite so long as Nebuchadnezzar's, they were long enough for a mandarin, and much longer than he found convenient.",
    "Thus he preserved an untroubled demeanour until the day of his death.",
    "Always polite, and even joyous, he met the smallest indulgence with enthusiasm.",
    "When Smith complained that a respite of six weeks was of small account, Brodie exclaimed, 'George, what would you and I give for six weeks longer?",
    "Six weeks would be an age to us.'",
    "The day of execution was the day of his supreme triumph.",
    "As some men are artists in their lives, so the Deacon was an artist in his death.",
    "Nothing became him so well as his manner of leaving the world.",
    "There is never a blot upon this exquisite performance.",
    "It is superb, impeccable!",
    "Again his dandyism supported him, and he played the part of a dying man in a full suit of black, his hair, as always, dressed and powdered.",
    "The day before he had been jovial and sparkling.",
    "He had chanted all his flash songs, and cracked the jokes of a man of fashion.",
    "But he set out for the gallows with a firm step and a rigorous demeanour.",
    "He offered a prayer of his own composing, and 'O Lord,' he said, 'I lament that I know so little of Thee.'",
    "The patronage and the confession are alike characteristic.",
    "As he drew near the scaffold, the model of which he had given to his native city a few years since, he stepped with an agile briskness; he examined the halter, destined for his neck, with an impartial curiosity.",
    "His last pleasantry was uttered as he ascended the table.",
    "'George,' he muttered, 'you are first in hand,' and thereafter he took farewell of his friends.",
    "Only one word of petulance escaped his lips: when the halters were found too short, his contempt for slovenly workmanship urged him to protest, and to demand a punishment for the executioner.",
    "Again ascending the table, he assured himself against further mishap by arranging the rope with his own hands.",
    "Thus he was turned off in a brilliant assembly.",
    "The Provost and Magistrates, in respect for his dandyism, were resplendent in their robes of office, and though the crowd of spectators rivalled that which paid a tardy honour to Jonathan Wild, no one was hurt save the customary policeman.",
    "Such was the dignified end of a 'double life.'",
    "And the duplicity is the stranger, because the real Deacon was not Brodie the Cracksman, but Brodie the Gentleman.",
    "So lightly did he esteem life that he tossed it from him in a careless impulse.",
    "So little did he fear death that, 'What is hanging?'",
    "he asked.",
    "'A leap in the dark.'",
    "CHARLES PEACE, after the habit of his kind, was born of scrupulously honest parents.",
    "The son of a religious file-maker, he owed to his father not only his singular piety but his love of edged tools.",
    "As he never encountered an iron bar whose scission baffled him, so there never was a fire-eating Methodist to whose ministrations he would not turn a repentant ear.",
    "After a handy portico and a rich booty he loved nothing so well as a soul-stirring discourse.",
    "Not even his precious fiddle occupied a larger space in his heart than that devotion which the ignorant have termed hypocrisy.",
    "Wherefore his career was no less suitable to his ambition than his inglorious end.",
    "For he lived the king of housebreakers, and he died a warning to all evildoers, with a prayer of intercession trembling upon his lips.",
    "The hero's boyhood is wrapped in obscurity.",
    "It is certain that no glittering precocity brought disappointment to his maturer years, and he was already nineteen when he achieved his first imprisonment.",
    "Even then 'twas a sorry offence, which merited no more than a month, so that he returned to freedom and his fiddle with his character unbesmirched.",
    "Serious as ever in pious exercises, he gained a scanty living as strolling musician.",
    "There was never a tavern in Sheffield where the twang of his violin was unheard, and the skill wherewith he extorted music from a single string earned him the style and title of the modern Paganini.",
    "But such an employ was too mean for his pride, and he soon got to work again-this time with a better success.",
    "The mansions of Sheffield were his early prey, and a rich plunder rewarded his intrepidity.",
    "The design was as masterly as its accomplishment.",
    "The grand style is already discernible.",
    "The houses were broken in quietude and good order.",
    "None saw the opened window; none heard the step upon the stair; in truth, the victim's loss was his first intelligence.",
    "But when the booty was in the robber's own safe keeping, the empiricism of his method was revealed.",
    "As yet he knew no secret and efficient fence to shield him from detection; as yet he had not learnt that the complete burglar works alone.",
    "This time he knew two accomplices-women both, and one his own sister!",
    "A paltry pair of boots was the clue of discovery, and a goodly stretch was the proper reward of a clumsy indiscretion.",
    "So for twenty years he wavered between the crowbar and the prison house, now perfecting a brilliant scheme, now captured through recklessness or drink.",
    "Once when a mistake at Manchester sent him to the Hulks, he owned his failure was the fruit of brandy, and after his wont delivered (from the dock) a little homily upon the benefit of sobriety.",
    "Meanwhile his art was growing to perfection.",
    "He had at last discovered that a burglary demands as diligent a forethought as a campaign; he had learnt that no great work is achieved by a multitude of minds.",
    "Before his boat carried off a goodly parcel of silk from Nottingham, he was known to the neighbourhood as an enthusiastic and skilful angler.",
    "One day he dangled his line, the next he sat peacefully at the same employ; and none suspected that the mild mannered fisherman had under the cloud of night despatched a costly parcel to London.",
    "Even the years of imprisonment were not ill-spent.",
    "Peace was still preparing the great achievement of his life, and he framed from solitary reflection as well as from his colleagues in crime many an ingenious theory afterwards fearlessly translated into practice.",
    "And when at last he escaped the slavery of the gaol, picture-framing was the pursuit which covered the sterner business of his life.",
    "His depredation involved him in no suspicion; his changing features rendered recognition impossible.",
    "When the exercise of his trade compelled him to shoot a policeman at Whalley Range, another was sentenced for the crime; and had he not encountered Mrs. Dyson, who knows but he might have practised his art in prosperous obscurity until claimed by a coward's death?",
    "But a stormy love-passage with Mrs. Dyson led to the unworthy killing of the woman's husband-a crime unnecessary and in no sense consonant to the burglar's craft; and Charles Peace was an outlaw, with a reward set upon his head.",
    "And now came a period of true splendour.",
    "Like Fielding, like Cervantes, like Sterne, Peace reserved his veritable masterpiece for the certainty of middle-life.",
    "His last two years were nothing less than a march of triumph.",
    "If you remember his constant danger, you will realise the grandeur of the scheme.",
    "From the moment that Peace left Bannercross with Dyson's blood upon his hands, he was a hunted man.",
    "His capture was worth five hundred pounds; his features were familiar to a hundred hungry detectives.",
    "Had he been less than a man of genius, he might have taken an unavailing refuge in flight or concealment.",
    "But, content with no safety unattended by affluence, he devised a surer plan: he became a householder.",
    "Now, a semi-detached villa is an impregnable stronghold.",
    "Respectability oozes from the dusky mortar of its bricks, and escapes in clouds of smoke from its soot-grimed chimneys.",
    "No policeman ever detects a desperate ruffian in a demure black-coated gentleman who day after day turns an iron gate upon its rusty hinge.",
    "And thus, wrapt in a cloak of suburban piety, Peace waged a pitiless and effective war upon his neighbours.",
    "He pillaged Blackheath, Greenwich, Peckham, and many another home of honest worth, with a noiselessness and a precision that were the envy of the whole family.",
    "The unknown and intrepid burglar was a terror to all the clerkdom of the City, and though he was as secret and secluded as Peace, the two heroes were never identified.",
    "At the time of his true eminence he 'resided' in Evelina Road, Peckham, and none was more sensible than he how well the address became his provincial refinement.",
    "There he installed himself with his wife and Mrs. Thompson.",
    "His drawing-room suite was the envy of the neighbourhood; his pony-trap proclaimed him a man of substance; his gentle manners won the respect of all Peckham.",
    "Hither he would invite his friends to such entertainments as the suburb expected.",
    "His musical evenings were recorded in the local paper, while on Sundays he chanted the songs of Zion with a zeal which Clapham herself might envy.",
    "The house in Evelina Road was no mere haunt of quiet gentility.",
    "It was chosen with admirable forethought and with a stern eye upon the necessities of business.",
    "Beyond the garden wall frowned a railway embankment, which enabled the cracksman to escape from his house without opening the front door.",
    "By the same embankment he might, if he chose, convey the trophies of the night's work; and what mattered it if the windows rattled to the passing train?",
    "At least a cloud of suspicion was dispelled.",
    "Here he lived for two years, with naught to disturb his tranquillity save Mrs. Thompson's taste for drink.",
    "The hours of darkness were spent in laborious activity, the open day brought its own distractions.",
    "There was always Bow Street wherein to loaf, and the study of the criminal law lost none of its excitement from the reward offered outside for the bald-headed fanatic who sat placidly within.",
    "And the love of music was Peace's constant solace.",
    "Whatever treasures he might discard in a hurried flight, he never left a fiddle behind, and so vast became his pilfered collection that he had to borrow an empty room in a friend's house for its better disposal.",
    "Moreover, he had a fervent pride in his craft; and you might deduce from his performance the whole theory and practice of burglary.",
    "He worked ever without accomplices.",
    "He knew neither the professional thief nor his lingo; and no association with gaol-birds involved him in the risk of treachery and betrayal.",
    "His single colleague was a friendly fence, and not even at the gallows' foot would he surrender the fence's name.",
    "His master quality was a constructive imagination.",
    "Accident never marred his design.",
    "He would visit the house of his breaking until he understood its ground-plan, and was familiar with its inhabitants.",
    "This demanded an amazing circumspection, but Peace was as stealthy as a cat, and he would keep silent vigil for hours rather than fail from an over keen anxiety.",
    "Having marked the place of his entry, and having chosen an appropriate hour, he would prevent the egress of his enemies by screwing up the doors.",
    "He then secured the room wherein he worked, and the job finished, he slung himself into the night by the window, so that, ere an alarm could be raised, his pony-trap had carried the booty to Evelina Road.",
    "Such was the outline of his plan; but, being no pedant, he varied it at will: nor was he likely to court defeat through lack of resource.",
    "Accomplished as he was in his proper business, he was equally alert to meet the accompanying risks.",
    "He had brought the art of cozening strange dogs to perfection; and for the exigence of escape, his physical equipment was complete.",
    "He would resist capture with unparalleled determination, and though he shuddered at the shedding of blood, he never hesitated when necessity bade him pull the trigger.",
    "Moreover, there was no space into which he would not squeeze his body, and the iron bars were not yet devised through which he could not make an exit.",
    "Once-it was at Nottingham-he was surprised by an inquisitive detective who demanded his name and trade.",
    "'I am a hawker of spectacles,' replied Peace, 'and my licence is downstairs.",
    "Wait two minutes and I'll show it you.'",
    "The detective never saw him again.",
    "Six inches only separated the bars of the window, but Peace asked no more, and thus silently he won his freedom.",
    "True, his most daring feat-the leap from the train-resulted not in liberty, but in a broken head.",
    "But he essayed a task too high even for his endeavour, and, despite his manacles, at least he left his boot in the astonished warder's grip.",
    "No less remarkable than his skill and daring were his means of evasion.",
    "Even without a formal disguise he could elude pursuit.",
    "At an instant's warning, his loose, plastic features would assume another shape; out shot his lower jaw, and, as if by magic, the blood flew into his face until you might take him for a mulatto.",
    "Or, if he chose, he would strap his arm to his side, and let the police be baffled by a wooden mechanism, decently finished with a hook.",
    "Thus he roamed London up and down unsuspected, and even after his last failure at Blackheath, none would have discovered Charles Peace in John Ward, the Single-Handed Burglar, had not woman's treachery prompted detection.",
    "Indeed, he was an epitome of his craft, the Complete Burglar made manifest.",
    "Not only did he plan his victories with previous ingenuity, but he sacrificed to his success both taste and sentiment.",
    "His dress was always of the most sombre; his only wear was the decent black of everyday godliness.",
    "The least spice of dandyism might have distinguished him from his fellows, and Peace's whole vanity lay in his craft.",
    "Nor did the paltry sentiment of friendship deter him from his just course.",
    "When the panic aroused by the silent burglar was uncontrolled, a neighbour consulted Peace concerning the safety of his house.",
    "The robber, having duly noted the villa's imperfections, and having discovered the hiding-place of jewellery and plate, complacently rifled it the next night.",
    "Though his self-esteem sustained a shock, though henceforth his friend thought meanly of his judgment, he was rewarded with the solid pudding of plunder, and the world whispered of the mysterious marauder with a yet colder horror.",
    "In truth, the large simplicity and solitude of his style sets him among the Classics, and though others have surpassed him at single points of the game, he practised the art with such universal breadth and courage as were then a revolution, and are still unsurpassed.",
    "But the burglar ever fights an unequal battle.",
    "One false step, and defeat o'erwhelms him.",
    "For two years had John Ward intimidated the middle-class seclusion of South London; for two years had he hidden from a curious world the ugly, furrowed visage of Charles Peace.",
    "The bald head, the broad-rimmed spectacles, the squat, thick figure-he stood but five feet four in his stockings, and adds yet another to the list of little-great men-should have ensured detection, but the quick change and the persuasive gesture were omnipotent, and until the autumn of 1878 Peace was comfortably at large.",
    "And then an encounter at Blackheath put him within the clutch of justice.",
    "His revolver failed in its duty, and, valiant as he was, at last he met his match.",
    "In prison he was alternately insolent and aggrieved.",
    "He blustered for justice, proclaimed himself the victim of sudden temptation, and insisted that his intention had been ever innocent.",
    "But, none the less, he was sentenced to a lifer, and, the mask of John Ward being torn from him, he was sent to Sheffield to stand his trial as Charles Peace.",
    "The leap from the train is already recorded; and at his last appearance in the dock he rolled upon the floor, a petulant and broken man.",
    "When once the last doom was pronounced, he forgot both fiddle and crowbar; he surrendered himself to those exercises of piety from which he had never wavered.",
    "The foolish have denounced him for a hypocrite, not knowing that the artist may have a life apart from his art, and that to Peace religion was an essential pursuit.",
    "So he died, having released from an unjust sentence the poor wretch who at Whalley Range had suffered for his crime, and offering up a consolatory prayer for all mankind.",
    "In truth, there was no enemy for whom he did not intercede.",
    "He prayed for his gaolers, for his executioner, for the Ordinary, for his wife, for Mrs. Thompson, his drunken doxy, and he went to his death with the sure step of one who, having done his duty, is reconciled with the world.",
    "The mob testified its affectionate admiration by dubbing him 'Charley,' and remembered with effusion his last grim pleasantry.",
    "'What is the scaffold?'",
    "he asked with sublime earnestness.",
    "And the answer came quick and sanctimonious: 'A short cut to Heaven!'",
    "NOT a parallel, but a contrast, since at all points Peace is Brodie's antithesis.",
    "The one is the austerest of Classics, caring only for the ultimate perfection of his work.",
    "The other is the gayest of Romantics, happiest when by the way he produces a glittering effect, or dazzles the ear by a vain impertinence.",
    "Now, it is by thievery that Peace reached magnificence.",
    "A natural aptitude drove him from the fiddle to the centre-bit.",
    "He did but rob, because genius followed the impulse.",
    "He had studied the remotest details of his business; he was sternly professional in the conduct of his life, and, as became an old gaol-bird, there was no antic of the policeman wherewith he was not familiar.",
    "Moreover, not only had he reduced house-breaking to a science, but, being ostensibly nothing better than a picture-frame maker, he had invented an incomparable set of tools wherewith to enter and evade his neighbour's house.",
    "Brodie, on the other hand, was a thief for distraction.",
    "His method was as slovenly as ignorance could make it.",
    "Though by trade a wright, and therefore a master of all the arts of joinery, he was so deficient in seriousness that he stole a coulter wherewith to batter the walls of the Excise Office.",
    "While Peace fought the battle in solitude, Brodie was not only attended by a gang, but listened to the command of his subordinates, and was never permitted to perform a more intricate duty than the sounding of the alarm.",
    "And yet here is the ironical contrast.",
    "Peace, the professional thief, despised his brothers, and was never heard to patter a word of flash.",
    "Brodie, the amateur, courted the society of all cross coves, and would rather express himself in Pedlar's French than in his choicest Scots.",
    "While the Englishman scraped Tate and Brady from a one-stringed fiddle, the Scot limped a chaunt from The Beggar's Opera, and thought himself a devil of a fellow.",
    "The one was a man about town masquerading as a thief; the other the most serious among housebreakers, singing psalms in all good faith.",
    "But if Peace was incomparably the better craftsman, Brodie was the prettier gentleman.",
    "Peace would not have permitted Brodie to drive his pony-trap the length of Evelina Road.",
    "But Brodie, in revenge, would have cut Peace had he met him in the Corn-market.",
    "The one was a sombre savage, the other a jovial comrade, and it was a witty freak of fortune that impelled both to follow the same trade.",
    "And thus you arrive at another point of difference.",
    "The Englishman had no intelligence of life's amenity.",
    "He knew naught of costume: clothes were the limit of his ambition.",
    "Dressed always for work, he was like the caterpillar which assumes the green of the leaf, wherein it hides: he wore only such duds as should attract the smallest notice, and separate him as far as might be from his business.",
    "But the Scot was as fine a dandy as ever took (haphazard) to the cracking of kens.",
    "If his refinement permitted no excess of splendour, he went ever gloriously and appropriately apparelled.",
    "He was well-mannered, cultured, with scarce a touch of provincialism to mar his gay demeanour: whereas Peace knew little enough outside the practice of burglary, and the proper handling of the revolver.",
    "Our Charles, for example, could neither spell nor write; he dissembled his low origin with the utmost difficulty, and at the best was plastered over (when not at work) with the parochialism of the suburbs.",
    "So far the contrast is complete; and even in their similarities there is an evident difference.",
    "Each led a double life; but while Brodie was most himself among his own kind, the real Peace was to be found not fiddle-scraping in Evelina Road but marking down policemen in the dusky byways of Blackheath.",
    "Brodie's grandeur was natural to him; Peace's respectability, so far as it transcended the man's origin, was a cloak of villainy.",
    "Each, again, was an inventor, and while the more innocent Brodie designed a gallows, the more hardened Peace would have gained notoriety by the raising of wrecks and the patronage of Mr. Plimsoll.",
    "And since both preserved a certain courage to the end, since both died on the scaffold as becomes a man, the contrast is once more characteristic.",
    "Brodie's cynicism is a fine foil to the piety of Peace; and while each end was natural after its own fashion, there is none who will deny to the Scot the finer sense of fitness.",
    "Nor did any step in their career explain more clearly the difference in their temperament than their definitions of the gallows.",
    "For Peace it is 'a short cut to Heaven'; for Brodie it is 'a leap in the dark.'",
    "Again the Scot has the advantage.",
    "Again you reflect that, if Peace is the most accomplished Classic among the housebreakers, the Deacon is the merriest companion who ever climbed the gallows by the shoulders of the incomparable Macheath.",
    "THE Abbe Bruneau, who gave his shaven head in atonement for unnumbered crimes, was a finished exponent of duplicity.",
    "In the eye of day and of Entrammes he shone a miracle of well-doing; by night he prowled in the secret places of Laval.",
    "The world watched him, habited in the decent black of his calling; no sooner was he beyond sight of his parish than his valise was opened, and he arrayed himself-under the hedge, no doubt-in a suit of jaunty grey.",
    "The pleasures for which he sacrificed the lives of others and his own were squalid enough, but they were the best a provincial brain might imagine; and he sinned the sins of a hedge priest with a courage and effrontery which his brethren may well envy.",
    "Indeed, the Man in the Grey Suit will be sent down the ages with a grimmer scandal, if with a staler mystery, than the Man in the Iron Mask.",
    "He was born of parents who were certainly poor, and possibly honest, at Asse-le-Berenger.",
    "He counted a dozen Chouans among his ancestry, and brigandage swam in his blood.",
    "Even his childhood was crimson with crimes, which the quick memory of the countryside long ago lost in the pride of having bred a priest.",
    "He stained his first cure of souls with the poor, sad sin of arson, which the bishop, fearful of scandal and loth to check a promising career, condoned with a suitable advancement.",
    "At Entrammes, his next benefice, he entered into his full inheritance of villainy, and here it was-despite his own protest-that he devised the grey suit which brought him ruin and immortality.",
    "To the wild, hilarious dissipation of Laval, the nearest town, he fell an immediate and unresisting prey.",
    "Think of the glittering lamps, the sparkling taverns, the bright-eyed women, the manifold fascinations, which are the character and delight of this forgotten city!",
    "Why, if the Abbe Bruneau doled out comfort and absolution at Entrammes-why should he not enjoy at Laval the wilder joys of the flesh?",
    "Lack of money was the only hindrance, since our priest was not of those who could pursue bonnes fortunes; ever he sighed for 'booze and the blowens,' but 'booze and the blowens' he could only purchase with the sovereigns his honest calling denied him.",
    "There was no resource but thievery and embezzlement, sins which led sometimes to falsehood or incendiarism, and at a pinch to the graver enterprise of murder.",
    "But Bruneau was not one to boggle at trifles.",
    "Women he would encounter-young or old, dark or fair, ugly or beautiful, it was all one to him-and the fools who withheld him riches must be punished for their niggard hand.",
    "For a while a theft here and there, a cunning extortion of money upon the promise of good works, sufficed for his necessities, but still he hungered for a coup, and patiently he devised and watched his opportunity.",
    "Meanwhile his cunning protected him, and even if the gaze of suspicion fell upon him he contrived his orgies with so neat a discretion that the Church, which is not wont to expose her malefactors, preserved a timid and an innocent silence.",
    "The Abbe disappeared with a commendable constancy, and with that just sense of secrecy which should compel even an archiepiscopal admiration.",
    "He was not of those who would drag his cloth through the mire.",
    "Not until the darkness he loved so fervently covered the earth would he escape from the dull respectability of Entrammes, nor did he ever thus escape unaccompanied by his famous valise.",
    "The grey suit was an effectual disguise to his calling, and so jealous was he of the Church's honour that he never-unless in his cups-disclosed his tonsure.",
    "One of his innumerable loves confessed in the witness-box that Bruneau always retained his hat in the glare of the Caf\ufffd, protesting that a headache rendered him fatally susceptible to draught; and such was his thoughtful punctilio that even in the comparative solitude of a guilty bed-chamber he covered his shorn locks with a nightcap.",
    "And while his conduct at Laval was unimpeachable, he always proved a nice susceptibility in his return.",
    "A cab carried him within a discreet distance of his home, whence, having exchanged the grey for the more sober black, he would tramp on foot, and thus creep in tranquil and unobserved.",
    "But simple as it is to enjoy, enjoyment must still be purchased, and the Abbe was never guilty of a meanness.",
    "The less guilty scheme was speedily staled, and then it was that the Abbe bethought him of murder.",
    "His first victim was the widow Bourdais, who pursued the honest calling of a florist at Laval.",
    "Already the curate was on those terms of intimacy which unite the robber with the robbed; for some months earlier he had imposed a forced loan of sixty francs upon his victim.",
    "But on the 15th of July 1893, he left Entrammes, resolved upon a serious measure.",
    "The black valise was in his hand, as he set forth upon the arid, windy road.",
    "Before he reached Laval he had made the accustomed transformation, and it was no priest, but a layman, doucely dressed in grey, that awaited Mme.",
    "Bourdais' return from the flower-market.",
    "He entered the shop with the coolness of a friend, and retreated to the door of the parlour when two girls came to make a purchase.",
    "No sooner had the widow joined him than he cut her throat, and, with the ferocity of the beast who loves blood as well as plunder, inflicted some forty wounds upon her withered frame.",
    "His escape was simple and dignified; he called the cabman, who knew him well, and who knew, moreover, what was required of him; and the priest was snugly in bed, though perhaps exhausted with blood and pleasure, when the news of the murder followed him to his village.",
    "Next day the crime was common gossip, and the Abbe's friends took counsel with him.",
    "One there was astonished that the culprit remained undiscovered.",
    "'But why should you marvel?'",
    "said Bruneau.",
    "'I could kill you and your wife at your own chimney-corner without a soul knowing.",
    "Had I taken to evil courses instead of to good I should have been a terrible assassin.'",
    "There is a touch of the pride which De Quincey attributes to Williams in this boastfulness, and throughout the parallel is irresistible.",
    "Williams, however, was the better dandy; he put on a dress-coat and patent-leather pumps because the dignity of his work demanded a fitting costume.",
    "And Bruneau wore the grey suit not without a hope of disguise.",
    "Yet you like to think that the Abbe looked complacently upon his valise, and had forethought for the cut of his professional coat; and if he be not in the first flight of artistry, remember his provincial upbringing, and furnish the proper excuse.",
    "Meanwhile the scandal of the murdered widow passed into forgetfulness, and the Abbe was still impoverished.",
    "Already he had robbed his vicar, and the suspicion of the Abbe Fricot led on to the final and the detected crime.",
    "Now Fricot had noted the loss of money and of bonds, and though he refrained from exposure he had confessed to a knowledge of the criminal.",
    "M. Bruneau was naturally sensitive to suspicion, and he determined upon the immediate removal of this danger to his peace.",
    "On January 2, 1894, M. Fricot returned to supper after administering the extreme unction to a parishioner.",
    "While the meal was preparing, he went into his garden in sabots and bareheaded, and never again was seen alive.",
    "The supper cooled, the vicar was still absent; the murderer, hungry with his toil, ate not only his own, but his victim's share of the food, grimly hinting that Fricot would not come back.",
    "Suicide was dreamed of, murder hinted; up and down the village was the search made, and none was more zealous than the distressed curate.",
    "At last a peasant discovered some blocks of wood in the well, and before long blood-stains revealed themselves on the masonry.",
    "Speedily was the body recovered, disfigured and battered beyond recognition, and the voice of the village went up in denunciation of the Abbe Bruneau.",
    "Immunity had made the culprit callous, and in a few hours suspicion became certainty.",
    "A bleeding nose was the lame explanation given for the stains which were on his clothes, on the table, on the keys of his harmonium.",
    "A quaint and characteristic folly was it that drove the murderer straight to the solace of his religion.",
    "You picture him, hot and red-handed from murder, soothing his battered conscience with some devilish Requiem for the unshrived soul he had just parted from its broken body, and leaving upon the harmonium the ineradicable traces of his guilt.",
    "Thus he lived, poised between murder and the Church, spending upon the vulgar dissipation of a Breton village the blood and money of his foolish victims.",
    "But for him 'les tavernes et les filles' of Laval meant a veritable paradise, and his sojourn in the country is proof enough of a limited cunning.",
    "Had he been more richly endowed, Paris had been the theatre of his crimes.",
    "As it is, he goes down to posterity as the Man in the Grey Suit, and the best friend the cabmen of Laval ever knew.",
    "Them, indeed, he left inconsolable.",
    "The childhood of the Abbe Rosselot is as secret as his origin, and no man may know whether Belfort or Bavaria smiled upon his innocence.",
    "A like mystery enshrouds his early manhood, and the malice of his foes, who are legion, denounces him for a Jesuit of Innsbruck.",
    "But since he has lived within the eye of the world his villainies have been revealed as clearly as his attainments, and history provides him no other rival in the corruption of youth than the infamous Thwackum.",
    "It is not every scholar's ambition to teach the elements, and Rosselot adopted his modest calling as a cloak of crime.",
    "No sooner was he installed in a mansion than he became the mansion's master, and henceforth he ruled his employer's domain with the tyrannical severity of a Grand Inquisitor.",
    "His soul wrapped in the triple brass of arrogance, he even dared to lay his hands upon food before his betters were served; and presently, emboldened by success, he would order the dinners, reproach the cook with a too lavish use of condiments, and descend with insolent expostulation into the kitchen.",
    "In a week he had opened the cupboards upon a dozen skeletons, and made them rattle their rickety bones up and down the draughty staircases, until the inmates shivered with horror and the terrified neighbours fled the haunted castle as a lazar-house.",
    "Once in possession of a family secret, he felt himself secure, and henceforth he was free to browbeat his employer and to flog his pupil to the satisfaction of his waspish nature.",
    "Moreover, he was endowed with all the insight and effrontery of a trained journalist.",
    "So sedulous was he in his search after the truth, that neither man nor woman could deny him confidence.",
    "And, as vinegar flowed in his veins for blood, it was his merry sport to set wife against husband and children against father.",
    "Not even were the servants safe from his watchful inquiry, and housemaids and governesses alike entrusted their hopes and fears to his malicious keeping.",
    "And when the house had retired to rest, with what a sinister delight did he chuckle over the frailties and infamies, a guilty knowledge of which he had dragged from many an unwilling sinner!",
    "To oust him, when installed, was a plain impossibility, for this wringer of hearts was only too glib in the surrender of another's scandal; and as he accepted the last scurrility with Christian resignation, his unfortunate employer could but strengthen his vocabulary and patiently endure the presence of this smiling, demoniacal tutor.",
    "But a too villainous curiosity was not the Abbe's capital sin.",
    "Not only did he entertain his leisure with wrecking the happiness of a united family, but he was an enemy open and declared of France.",
    "It was his amiable pastime at the dinner-table, when he had first helped himself to such delicacies as tempted his dainty palate, to pronounce a pompous eulogy upon the German Emperor.",
    "France, he would say with an exultant smile, is a pays pourri, which exists merely to be the football of Prussia.",
    "She has but one hope of salvation-still the monster speaks-and that is to fall into the benign occupation of a vigorous race.",
    "Once upon a time-the infamy is scarce credible-he was conducting his young charges past a town-hall, over the lintel of whose door glittered those proud initials 'R.",
    "F.' 'What do they stand for?'",
    "asked this demon Barlow.",
    "And when the patriotic Tommy hesitated for an answer, the preceptor exclaimed with ineffable contempt, 'Race de fous'!",
    "It is no wonder, then, that this foe of his fatherland feared to receive a letter openly addressed; rather he would slink out under cover of night and seek his correspondence at the poste restante, like a guilty lover or a British tourist.",
    "The Chateau de Presles was built for his reception.",
    "It was haunted by a secret, which none dare murmur in the remotest garret.",
    "There was no more than a whisper of murder in the air, but the Marquis shuddered when his wife's eye frowned upon him.",
    "True, the miserable Menaldo had disappeared from his seminary ten years since, but threats of disclosure were uttered continually, and respectability might only be purchased by a profound silence.",
    "Here was the Abbe's most splendid opportunity, and he seized it with all the eagerness of a greedy temperament.",
    "The Marquise, a wealthy peasant, who was rather at home on the wild hill-side than in her stately castle, became an instant prey to his devilish intrigue.",
    "The governess, an antic old maid of fifty-seven, whose conversation was designed to bring a blush to the cheek of the most hardened dragoon, was immediately on terms of so frank an intimacy that she flung bread pellets at him across the table, and joyously proposed, if we may believe the priest on his oath, to set up housekeeping with him, that they might save expense.",
    "Two high-spirited boys were always at hand to encourage his taste for flogging, and had it not been for the Marquis, the Abbe's cup would have been full to overflowing.",
    "But the Marquis loved not the lean, ogling instructor of his sons, and presently began to assail him with all the abuse of which he was master.",
    "He charged the Abbe with unspeakable villainy; salop and saligaud were the terms in which he would habitually refer to him.",
    "He knew the rascal for a spy, and no modesty restrained him from proclaiming his knowledge.",
    "But whatever insults were thrown at the Abbe he received with a grin complacent as Shylock's, for was he not conscious that when he liked the pound of flesh was his own!",
    "With a fiend's duplicity he laid his plans of ruin and death.",
    "The Marquise, swayed to his will, received him secretly in the blue room (whose very colour suggests a guilty intrigue), though never, upon the oath of an Abbe, when the key was turned in the lock.",
    "A journey to Switzerland had freed him from the haunting suspicion of the Marquis, and at last he might compel the wife to denounce her husband as a murderer.",
    "The terrified woman drew the indictment at the Abbe's dictation, and when her husband returned to St. Amand he was instantly thrust into prison.",
    "Nothing remained but to cajole the sons into an expressed hatred of their father, and the last enormity was committed by a masterpiece of cunning.",
    "'Your father's one chance of escape,' argued this villain in a cassock, 'is to be proved an inhuman ruffian.",
    "Swear that he beat you unmercifully and you will save him from the guillotine.'",
    "All the dupes learned their lesson with a certainty which reflects infinite credit upon the Abbe's method of instruction.",
    "For once in his life the Abbe had been moved by greed as well as by villainy.",
    "His early exploits had no worse motive than the satisfaction of an inhuman lust for cruelty and destruction.",
    "But the Marquise was rich, and when once her husband's head were off, might not the Abbe reap his share of the gathered harvest?",
    "The stakes were high, but the game was worth the playing, and Rosselot played it with spirit and energy unto the last card.",
    "His appearance in court is ever memorable, and as his ferret eyes glinted through glass at the President, he seemed the villain of some Middle Age Romance.",
    "His head, poised upon a lean, bony frame, was embellished with a nose thin and sharp as the blade of a knife; his tightly compressed lips were an indication of the rascal's determination.",
    "'Long as a day in Lent'-that is how a spectator described him; and if ever a sinister nature glared through a sinister figure, the Abbe's character was revealed before he parted his lips in speech.",
    "Unmoved he stood and immovable; he treated the imprecations of the Marquis with a cold disdain; as the burden of proof grew heavy on his back, he shrugged his shoulders in weary indifference.",
    "He told his monstrous story with a cynical contempt, which has scarce its equal in the history of crime; and priest, as he was, he proved that he did not yield to the Marquis himself in the Rabelaisian amplitude of his vocabulary.",
    "He brought charges against the weird world of Presles with an insouciance and brutality which defeated their own aim.",
    "He described the vices of his master and the sins of the servants in a slang which would sit more gracefully upon an idle roysterer than upon a pious Abbe.",
    "And, his story ended, he leered at the Court with the satisfaction of one who had discharged a fearsome duty.",
    "But his rascality overshot its mark; the Marquise, obedient to his priestly casuistry, displayed too fierce a zeal in the execution of his commands.",
    "And he took to flight, hoping to lose in the larger world of Paris the notoriety which his prowess won him among the poor despised Berrichons.",
    "He left behind for our consolation a snatch of philosophy which helps to explain his last and greatest achievement.",
    "'Those who have money exist only to be fleeced.'",
    "Thus he spake with a reckless revelation of self.",
    "Yet the mystery of his being is still unpierced.",
    "He is traitor, schemer, spy; but is he an Abbe?",
    "Perhaps not.",
    "At any rate, he once attended the 'Messe des Morts,' and was heard to mumble a 'Credo,' which, as every good Catholic remembers, has no place in that solemn service."

    "When she was a child, Kaye said, Florrie would send her and her brothers just a single dollar bill for Christmas (a gift that later became $5, plus a box of Kathy's expensive hand-me-downs).",
    "Florrie's younger sister, meanwhile, sent Kaye and Kathy $50.",
    "According to Acker, her Nana disdained regular clothing stores because \"other humans shopped in them,\" and she had her own dressmaker.",
    "That Christmas was important at all suggests how little emphasis the family placed on its Jewishness.",
    "Acker would later say that she was \"glad\" to be Jewish\u2014\"I think we're intellectual, tough, funny,\" she told an interviewer, adding that she liked \"the wandering business, not being nationalistic.\"",
    "But Acker's mother, Claire, did her best to downplay their faith; while she would be involved in various Jewish causes and organizations, according to Acker and other friends, Claire would have much preferred to be a blue-blooded WASP and acted accordingly\u2014both the school and the summer camp that Acker attended as a girl were largely devoid of Jews.",
    "Claire was born to Florrie and Albert on June 7, 1925.",
    "She was their only child and, Kaye remembered, adored and spoiled.",
    "At the same time, she seemed to live forever in Florrie's shadow, perpetually reliant on her mother's largesse and fearful of her wrath.",
    "Acker recounted one childhood memory of looking through drawers in her parents' closet.",
    "There she found a soft gray hat that she promptly put on her head.",
    "When Claire saw it, she snatched it away and slapped her daughter across the face.",
    "She told Kathy that it was her father's old hat and that Kathy was never to touch it again.",
    "Albert, Claire went on, was \"the kindest man who ever lived,\" and Florrie the opposite.",
    "\"You know what she's like,\" Claire said.",
    "\"She still tells me what to do.",
    "You saw what happened with that dress I bought at the beginning of this week.",
    "She saw it on me and didn't like it.",
    "I had to take it back to the store.",
    "I'm 37 years old.\"",
    "In a prose poem that was part of Acker's first self-published chapbook, Politics, she claims that Claire inherited $250,000 from her father, but that she gave the money back to Florrie so \"that her mother would still support her.\"",
    "As an adult, Claire was physically beautiful: petite, with dark hair she kept short as she aged, and bewitching emerald eyes.",
    "Constantly conscious of her weight, she took \"diet pills\"\u2014amphetamines\u2014to keep it down.",
    "Her moods were unpredictable (the speed didn't help), and she could be narcissistic, arbitrarily cruel, extremely strict.",
    "She was intelligent but inhibited by the culture and the time period\u2014she received no postsecondary education, became a mother at a young age, and never held a paying job.",
    "She did volunteer at the Jewish Guild for the Blind, typing books into Braille, as well as at an organization for \"unwed mothers,\" according to her daughter and Acker's half sister Wendy Bowers, taking the young women to doctors' appointments.",
    "She shopped often and played mahjong once a week with the same group of women.",
    "Over the years, she had many dogs, always poodles, that she doted on.",
    "She usually dressed, Acker wrote, like a fifties \"dowager,\" even into the seventies: tight cashmere sweater skirts hemmed at the knee, stockings, high black heels, small Gucci purse, bright red lipstick.",
    "\"She seemed bright, probably underchallenged in her life,\" said Peter Gordon, Acker's second husband.",
    "\"She sort of had a little edge to her and a twinkle.\"",
    "Others recalled her a bit less kindly: \"I remember Claire on one of the very few occasions that I was invited to their apartment as being detached and aloof,\" Kaye said, \"more concerned about an upcoming session with her manicurist than being a good hostess.\"",
    "Bowers felt she was, on the whole, extremely conservative and saw everything as \"black-and-white.\"",
    "In the story that Acker would tell over and over in her books, and with only slight variation, Claire became seriously ill when she was twenty-one or twenty-two years old.",
    "A doctor told her that getting pregnant would somehow cure her.",
    "Claire did get pregnant, but the illness persisted.",
    "She wanted an abortion but was too frightened to get one.",
    "After Kathy was born, Claire was properly diagnosed with appendicitis.",
    "But before that, the man who had impregnated her had left both of them.",
    "\"Let me tell you what is was like in that womb,\" Acker wrote in one of her last notebooks.",
    "\"After my father walked out.",
    "Absence isn't absent; it's pain.\"",
    "Acker's relationship with her mother would become extremely complicated, to say the least, but in these final notebook entries, she makes clear, yet again, how deeply she identified with Claire:                 She was raw, a kid, with all the faults of a kid so now all she felt was rage, unadulterated fury.",
    "She would kill.",
    "She would kill that baby in the womb.",
    "She knew why he was leaving her\u2014it was that kid in my womb\u2014she had never wanted one anyway\u2014the doc, he was a quack, he must be a quack, told her that if she got pregnant she wouldn't have this pain in her abdomen\u2014she hated pain because she was a beautiful kid.",
    "What did she want with a brat since she was a brat?",
    "Get out of here.",
    "Get rid of it.",
    "Get rid of him too; he was walking out on her; she loved and adored him so much she would never love again.",
    "This pain was retrospective, however\u2014Kathy wouldn't discover this abandonment, or the name of her birth father, until she was a teenager.",
    "For the first few years of her childhood, she had no reason to think that the man who called himself her father and whose name was printed on her birth certificate was not her actual parent.",
    "Albert Alexander was known as Bud (perhaps to distinguish him from Claire's father and grandfather, all of whom shared the same name).",
    "His early adulthood was eventful if somewhat wayward: he dropped out of college at nineteen to run a clothing store; married, had a son, and then promptly divorced; was drafted into the army in July 1943, and spent the remaining years of World War II in the service.",
    "Nobody recalled how and where he might have met Claire, but when they did meet, she was three or four months pregnant with Kathy.",
    "They married soon after, and when Kathy was born, he raised her as his own daughter.",
    "Bud was thin, short, balding.",
    "After her father's death, Florrie had taken over the glove company, and Bud worked for her there as administrator, seemingly continuing to do so even after the company was later sold.",
    "He made a good salary, Bowers remembered.",
    "Acker characterized him often in her fiction as a dissolute alcoholic, though Bowers recalled his drinking as no worse than the average consumption of the era\u2014a beer or two every night when he came home from work.",
    "Robert Acker, Acker's first husband, described him as a \"cipher,\" and indeed, his presence within the family, in the world, was almost imperceptible.",
    "\"He went to work every day,\" Bowers said.",
    "\"Did his job.",
    "On Sundays, we'd go to Rockefeller Center and go ice skating.",
    "Other than that, I mean, he was there.",
    "Was he a great father?",
    "No.\"",
    "Within Pooh Kaye's family, Bud's mild-manned remove registered as something worse.",
    "They considered him a playboy, ineffectual and lazy, undeniably reliant on his wife's money.",
    "\"My father had huge contempt for Kathy's father.",
    "The family was not too fond of him.\"",
    "Kaye claimed.",
    "In her writing, Acker is similarly scornful; the lightly fictionalized Bud character found in her books is consistently characterized as stupid, dull, his gentleness more a sign of weakness than virtue.",
    "His greatest sin is his indifference to art and literature.",
    "He also, it seemed, wished that Acker was a boy, and sometimes treated her that way.",
    "When she was born, Acker was named Karen, after Bud's sister.",
    "But Claire apparently despised the woman, and refused to call her daughter by that name, preferring, instead the nickname Kathy.",
    "\"Karen\" was so rarely used outside of official channels, in fact, that Bowers claimed to have never heard it.",
    "\"She gave me this name she hated,\" Acker wrote of her mother.",
    "\"Only when very drunk do I mention that name.\"",
    "From the very beginning, then, Kathy's identity was literally up for grabs, and the process of naming, and the interpellation of women, would become a subject at the heart of her fiction.",
    "\"As a girl,\" Acker would later write, \"I was outside the world.",
    "I wasn't.",
    "I had no name.\"",
    "A name, she learned, could be both a privilege and a prison.",
    "UNTIL SHE LEFT NEW YORK for college in 1964, Kathy only ever lived in one place, on the sixth floor of a nineteen-story, prewar building at 400 East 57th Street, at First Avenue.",
    "The building was located at the edge of Sutton Place, a highly affluent enclave just blocks from midtown and home, over the years, to such celebrities as Henry Kissinger, I. M. Pei, and Bill Blass.",
    "In 1956, Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe were the Alexanders' neighbors, occupying a penthouse apartment at 444 East 57th.",
    "Kathy's home, however, was somewhat more Sutton Place adjacent\u2014rent-controlled, relatively modest, on the small side.",
    "It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a sunken living room, a tiny kitchen.",
    "After Wendy was born, on July 1, 1949, the two girls shared a room, and would do so throughout their childhood and adolescence, a fact that forever vexed Kathy (she was still complaining about it with her psychic when she was in her late forties).",
    "In Requiem, one of her last works, Acker described the apartment thusly:             A small apartment\u2014its interior reveals that its inhabitants aren't all that wealthy.",
    "A narrow, dark green hall leads, on one side, to a large sunken living room, the largest room in the apartment.",
    "All the sofas and chairs in this room, of which there are many, have silk exteriors; the clear plastic that Claire explains are [sic] needed to protect the pale silks from stains are never taken off except when there are guests.",
    "There are a number of antiques including a captain's desk in which there are hiding places, a table whose inlaid pads are the color of ivy.",
    "A cabinet replete with china dogs supervises the large writing desk, of the same wood, beneath it.",
    "No one ever uses this desk.",
    "Acker also recalled that she wasn't permitted to put up any pictures or photographs on the walls of her room, and that Claire, despite spending lots of money on her own clothes and furnishings, never changed the rose-patterned drapes or the green paint on the walls of her daughters' room.",
    "Even as they grew into teenagers, Kathy and Wendy still had the same single beds they slept in as children.",
    "Kathy's refuge, as a young child, was the tiny park at the end of the street, beside the East River, where she sometimes went to play with her mother.",
    "For Kathy, the park offered possibility and solitude, as well as access to the natural world (as domesticated as it was), the sea, even other lands.",
    "In Great Expectations, this park is the site of a rare, enchanted, but ultimately fleeting, Christmas moment she shares with Claire: \"I stay in this magic snow with the beautiful yellow sun beating down on me as long as I can until a voice in my head (me) or my mother says, 'Now you know what this experience is, you have to leave.'\"",
    "In all of her books, Acker describes the family home as a \"prison,\" though, in many ways, it was far more ordinary and comfortable than that.",
    "Indeed, the outward conventionality of Acker's early childhood offers no hint of her future restlessness or iconoclasm.",
    "Bowers recalled that the family ate dinner together every night, then the girls would do their homework.",
    "Afterward, they would all retreat to Claire and Bud's bedroom, where they kept their only TV, and the family would gather on the bed and watch together.",
    "As she got older, Kathy rarely participated in this ritual, preferring to read alone in her room.",
    "The poodles were an ever-present feature of the apartment, both amusement and annoyance.",
    "Wendy and Kathy got along reasonably well, though even then they were clearly different\u2014the former more athletic and less bookish.",
    "Both girls were extremely sheltered.",
    "Their early lives were a small, closed circuit: school, home, school, home.",
    "If they went anywhere else\u2014to Broadway shows, Rockefeller Center, to the park at the end of the street\u2014it was always with their parents or grandmother.",
    "Among the many objects that Acker possessed at her death was an album of family photographs.",
    "It was large and pumpkin orange, its plastic cover smudged and tacky from decades of handling.",
    "Inside, glued to pages of faded, occasionally torn scrapbook paper, were just over a hundred black-and-white photographs of Kathy, Wendy, and other family members, some identified, some not.",
    "Here was baby Kathy at six weeks, held by Claire; a two-year-old Kathy, in Bud's arms, outside a Gristedes supermarket.",
    "In a photo taken in Westport, Connecticut, Kathy and Wendy pose in the grass with a nameless spaniel and their grandmother's African-American housekeeper, Grace Brown, who often served as their nanny.",
    "Aside from a photograph of Kathy talking on the phone, in which she looks to be about twelve, all of the pictures in the album are of her as an infant or young child.",
    "\"I tried to run away from the pain named childhood,\" Acker writes in My Mother: Demonology, \"like you flush a huge shit down the toilet.",
    "I've been running ever since.\"",
    "But here, in these photographs at least, there's little evidence of this pain.",
    "There is, in fact, only its opposite: a smiling, tiny Kathy, perched on a pony, or beaming beside a Christmas tree, seemingly cherished by everyone around her.",
    "She looks like a sweet child, with plump lips and dark, expressive eyes.",
    "She doesn't seem to mind the camera, and in most of these pictures, smiles broadly (and much more frequently than Wendy, at least).",
    "Of course, a single family photo album is a small, overdetermined, and unrepresentative sample.",
    "It shows little, proves nothing.",
    "But it was apparently the only trace of her family that Acker held on to throughout her adult life, and it remains the only real record of Acker's youth.",
    "It's easy to imagine Acker coming back again and again to these images as inspirational prods for her writing.",
    "Or perhaps simply to return to a bygone, relatively innocent time, reminding Acker of what she was like before the abandonment and death that would shadow her later years.",
    "Many of the photographs show the girls at the beach.",
    "When Kathy was seven or eight, Florrie bought a summer home in Atlantic Beach, on the South Shore of Long Island.",
    "Thereafter, the family vacationed there every year, driving out as soon as school ended.",
    "Bud would still work in the city and would commute by train at the end of the day.",
    "The house was a block from the beach, and for some reason, Florrie was a member of one beach club, and Bud and Claire a different one.",
    "In any case, until they went to camp in Maine in their early adolescence, Kathy and Wendy spent every summer day at the ocean.",
    "By all accounts, Kathy was always much closer to her Nana than to anyone else in the family.",
    "Where Claire seemed weak and dependent, Florrie was a confident, self-reliant survivor.",
    "\"She saw Florrie as a tower of strength,\" Pooh Kaye said, \"and someone who got her way.\"",
    "Kathy craved Florrie's admiration and respect, things that Claire also presumably desired but never seemed to receive.",
    "Florrie was more cultured than Claire as well\u2014she was the one who took Kathy and Wendy to galleries and museums.",
    "When Acker first began to self-publish, she sent her chapbooks to Florrie, and, according to Kaye, her grandmother was \"full of praise, much to Kathy's surprise and complete delight.\"",
    "Bowers concurred with this: \"She understood what she was trying to accomplish with her writing.",
    "I think my grandmother understood Kathy better than my mother did.\"",
    "In Acker's writing, Claire is villain and victim at once, and above all, a black hole\u2014all-consuming, unknowable.",
    "\"I'm probably concerned with my mother in my texts,\" Acker wrote in an essay late in life.",
    "\"I'm concerned with the father and my mother.\"",
    "The French feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray gave Acker some theoretical ballast here, arguing that, in a patriarchal culture, women are compelled to have a doubled, ambiguous relationship with their mothers: \"On the one hand, my mother was or is my lover,\" Acker wrote.",
    "\"On the other hand, my mother was a victim in the male-defined society.",
    "So, if I identify with her, I'm forced to define myself as a victim.",
    "So how do I deal with this double bind?",
    "Go mad?",
    "(Pun intended.)",
    "Irigaray says we, females, have to reinstate the mother as another person.",
    "I take that rather seriously.\"",
    "It's frustrating therefore to have so little firsthand evidence of Claire's life and personality, other than, of course, Acker's words themselves.",
    "As the architect of her own myth, Acker was fortunate to have a family that did not keep records.I Outside of those published words, however, are the many notebooks and letters in which Acker worked out her fiction, drafted and rehearsed it, and the details within those pages are specific and consistent enough to constitute a portrait of some verifiable fidelity.",
    "\"Most of it is true,\" Wendy Bowers averred, when asked of the novels' accuracy.",
    "Bowers felt that she and Kathy had a happy early childhood, though Bowers also describes Claire as a \"very strict\" woman who completely controlled their young lives.",
    "\"I think we agreed about a lot of things about our mother, but I was able to accept who she was,\" Bowers said.",
    "\"I think my sister had a hard time with it.\"",
    "Indeed, the Claire that haunts Acker's writing is a complex and enigmatic figure, a mother both remote and authoritarian, malevolent and pathetic.",
    "From the beginning, when she gives Kathy a name that she hates, Claire makes her child an object of derision.",
    "She rarely expresses love or affection, never gives Kathy gifts, even at Christmas.",
    "When Kathy is very young, she has a beloved pink blanket, covered in appliqu\u00e9d roses; at some point, Claire takes it away to get cleaned and then never bothers to return it.",
    "She is also capable of physical cruelty; a story Acker told several people, and repeated in her writing, was that, on at least one occasion, Claire ambushed Kathy in the shower and threw a glass of cold water on her, apparently hoping that her daughter would slip and fall.",
    "In another, darker version of the story, Claire tried to drown her.",
    "All of these injustices, from the minor to the grave, deeply marked Acker.",
    "She tallied all the above in one of the notebooks she kept for her novel My Mother: Demonology, summing them up thusly: \"These are all the accounts of how my mother tried to kill me.\"",
    "Above all, in Acker's mind, Claire hated Kathy because Kathy ruined her life.",
    "By getting pregnant, Claire lost Kathy's father and was forced to settle for a marriage to a man she didn't really love, to sacrifice herself to a life of compromise and dissatisfaction.",
    "\"She tells him that he's worthless,\" she writes of Bud and Claire's marriage in Requiem.",
    "\"He has a job only because he married into the family, all the wealth is on her side of the family.",
    "He tells her that he bought her her first mink coat.",
    "They go through this every single day.\"",
    "For Kathy, Claire never fulfilled her potential, whatever that potential may have been.",
    "She was a quintessential 1950s American housewife, a dumb stereotype slowly wasting her life, ultimately consumed by her own dissatisfaction.",
    "Her most important role, then, for Kathy, was to serve as a negative example.",
    "Kathy looked at Claire and determined that she would live as differently as possible.",
    "She would lead a purposeful, creative, self-directed life.",
    "She would never let anyone tell her what to do.",
    "\"I have no sense of a person,\" Acker wrote of Claire, \"I have a sense of my mother.",
    "My mother was a person; she stopped me from doing what I wanted to do.",
    "I wanted to get away from her.\"",
    "And Acker would not place anyone's needs above her own.",
    "For the rest of her life, she would never really take responsibility for anyone other than herself.",
    "I. Pooh Kaye recalled that her own unstable mother cleaned out a trunk full of family letters and documents, including several letters from Acker to Kaye's father, Clifford, and replaced them, bizarrely, with McDonald's hamburger wrappers.",
    "THE POSTWAR AMERICA THAT KATHY grew up in was one of unprecedented prosperity and stability.",
    "The population boomed, government spending boomed, and there was a sense that the country was, or would soon become, almost entirely middle-class, both in terms of its values and its economy.",
    "While capitalism seemed to have triumphed, and consumerism was in ascendance, full employment and poverty relief were undeniably still goals, taxes were high, and the country was still a limited welfare state.",
    "Benefitting immensely from the countless European scientists, artists, and intellectuals who had found refuge in the United States, however, and with its industrial infrastructure intact and thriving, the country dominated global affairs.",
    "With many great European cities still in ruin, New York City reasserted itself as a global capital of commerce, art, and politics.",
    "A sense of conciliation and consensus prevailed.",
    "At the same time, the U.S. simmered with anxiety\u2014over Communism and its spread both internationally and within the country's borders; over the creeping corporatization of life and politics; over evolving ideas around race, family, and gender.",
    "Millions of women had entered the workforce during World War II, and while many returned to life as mothers and homemakers, the sense of expanded possibility led directly to the emergence of women's liberation the following decade.",
    "The development of the birth control pill, which began in 1950, further amplified this shift.",
    "While mainstream society extolled bureaucracy, conformity, and unity, a fledgling counterculture was taking shape in opposition to these values.",
    "The best-known representatives of this so-called Beat Generation were its literary stars\u2014Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs\u2014who first congregated at Columbia University and in Greenwich Village.",
    "From the outset, Kathy was trained to do much more than keep house or raise children.",
    "In 1952, when she was five years old, she started at the Lenox School, an all-girls prep school located at 170 East 70th Street.",
    "The suffragette and educator Jessica Garretson Finch founded Lenox in 1916.",
    "A Barnard graduate who felt that her education had left her with no practical skills, Finch had previously started the Finch School (later Finch College) as a secondary school to prepare women for the working world; Lenox was, in turn, created to prepare girls for Finch.",
    "Lenox's four-story Renaissance Revival limestone building was built as a carriage house and horse stable in 1902 and purchased by Lenox in 1925.I By the standards of mid-century New York private schools, Lenox wasn't considered the finest education available, but it was unquestionably top-notch.",
    "Its head of school, Cecily Selby, was a renowned scientist with a degree in physics from Radcliffe and a doctorate in physical biology from MIT, and was working to make Lenox even more academically rigorous.",
    "Classes were small and intimate, and the teachers could be compelling, the curriculum strictly defined but ambitious.",
    "In grade seven, British history was mandatory; in grade eight, American.",
    "Students had to learn two additional languages, French and Latin.",
    "The school could be claustrophobic and regimented\u2014classes of twenty were divided into two sections, \"the smart and the not-smart,\" according to Linda Muller Vasu, one of Kathy's classmates\u2014but there was also often, Vasu said, a pervasive atmosphere of joy in its halls.",
    "Kathy was, apparently, a sterling student from the beginning: bright and bookish and hardworking.",
    "The cloistered, circumscribed life that she continued to lead\u2014it was still just school, home, Long Island\u2014might have been constricting, but it hadn't occurred to her yet to resist it.",
    "It's possible Kathy started writing during those earliest grades\u2014she later claimed that she won a poetry contest in the sixth grade\u2014but it's more likely her serious writing efforts didn't begin until high school, where she did, in fact, win a writing contest or two.",
    "Kathy's classmates were awash in money and privilege.",
    "By the time she got to high school, her classmates included Faith Golding, a real estate heiress whose father owned Essex House on Central Park and controlled the Sterling National Bank, and who, at eighteen, married twenty-two-year-old Ron Perelman, later one of Wall Street's most notorious corporate raiders and New York's richest man; Sherry Frawley, whose father was the proprietor of Pete's Tavern, the renowned Gramercy Park pub; and Betsy Kimmelman, daughter of hotelier Milton Kimmelman, who owned the Sherry-Netherland, the Ambassador, and the Barbizon, among many others.",
    "These were teenagers with their own chauffeurs and apartments.",
    "She and Wendy, on the other hand, took the bus to school.",
    "\"I was born a rich kid,\" Acker would later tell an interviewer, but at Lenox she learned that there were kids born much wealthier and more advantaged than she.",
    "In \"The Invisible Universe,\" an essay Acker published in 1982, she asks how a great writer comes into being.",
    "Her answer was characteristically overwrought, remarkable, and oblique, but in its run-on pileup of adjectives and nouns as revealing a self-portrait as any other she composed: \"Hatred antipathy to human fear of everything selfishness inability to communicate deformed physical attributes chronic illnesses moods-like-demons in particular: epileptic escapism, thundering na\u00efve desires?\"",
    "Books were a place for Kathy to engage that escapism, to satisfy her thundering na\u00efve desires.",
    "She started reading at an early age, and found in literature not just a place to escape but a place for everything.",
    "Books were the most romantic, even sacred, of objects; they were time machines, genie lamps, merit badges, force fields.",
    "They provided insulation from the actual life she led, and opened up the possibility of other, more captivating lives; she could, literally, lose herself in books.",
    "\"When I was a kid I always thought of books as more real than anything else,\" she told an interviewer.",
    "\"I had a bad childhood and books really were my reality.\"",
    "To write books, then, to become a writer herself, was to create her own reality.",
    "She could summon love, exorcise hatred, and ultimately exact revenge on those who had rejected or hurt her.",
    "She was a precocious reader too.",
    "While Claire read a fair bit also, mostly murder mysteries, Kathy told Wendy early in their youth that she was going to read \"every single classic.\"",
    "At Lenox, her classmates recalled, she proudly carried around Modern Library editions of those classics, their covers always faced outward to advertise their contents.",
    "The first adult authors she read were Dickens, Blake, and Hawthorne.",
    "As this peacocking suggests, Kathy was competitive too, and books and writing were her preferred arena.",
    "\"Books are the only people who like me,\" she wrote, half-jokingly, a decade later.",
    "This wasn't quite true of her in high school.",
    "Kathy had her fair share of friends there, and teachers who openly adored her.",
    "But nevertheless, just as at home, she felt apart, different, lonely.",
    "If she was not exactly an outcast, to a large extent she considered herself an outsider.",
    "She tended to lean into this difference and strangeness, but in truth, she occupied a more in-between position, one she found herself in throughout much of her life, in fact\u2014at once inside and outside, alienated and reconciled, blessed and cursed.",
    "In grade seven, she met twin sisters Linda and Susan Muller,II who would become both good friends and fierce rivals.",
    "The Mullers were outsiders of a sort too.",
    "Though well-off, their parents were divorced, an anomaly at the time; the girls lived on Park Avenue with their mother.",
    "Kathy and the Mullers were all in the \"smart\" section of their grade, and would meet for study dates or talk about their homework over the phone.",
    "Linda recalled that their conversations were largely a blur of checking in and one-upmanship, particularly once they all got to high school.",
    "\"Have you read this, have you done the math, what's your science project, what do you think about Gogol's The Overcoat?\"",
    "They sometimes played bridge at the Mullers' apartment, staying up until two or three in the morning, then heading to Reuben's, a twenty-four-hour deli, for a late-night, early morning breakfast.",
    "Linda remembered Kathy always wanting to be a writer, nothing else, and that she kept a commonplace book in which to chronicle her reading.",
    "But the Kathy she recalled was also an unabashed free spirit, physically unkempt and emotionally volatile.",
    "The Mullers were identical twins, and tall, blonde, and beautiful.",
    "Teenaged Kathy, in contrast, was small and somewhat gawky, with a mouth too big for her body, an effect she enhanced by not washing or combing her hair and often showing up to school in a grubby uniform.",
    "In retrospect, this seems like a deliberate, easy expression of defiance; it reinforced her sense of difference, her disregard for conventional behavior and appearance.",
    "To Linda, it suggested something more, that Kathy was virtually feral, basically unparented.",
    "\"She never cared about how she looked,\" Linda said.",
    "\"And most adolescents do.",
    "She was smelly.",
    "She was not particularly attractive.",
    "Nor was she friendly.",
    "She had the sorts of traits and values and mindset of a motherless female.\"",
    "In the classroom too, she was blithe about following rules, speaking without raising her hand, assertive and confrontational.",
    "Miraculously, her teachers usually tolerated such behavior; all was forgiven because of Kathy's academic brilliance and boundless curiosity.",
    "Linda found Kathy refreshingly authentic, particularly for a teenager, but she was also somewhat afraid of and for her.",
    "This feeling became more acute when Kathy began to have sex, the first girl, Linda remembered, in their class to do so.",
    "\"This was a huge thing in a girls' school,\" Linda said, \"and she defined herself early on in that way.\"",
    "By the ninth grade, the three girls were going to weekend parties, and Linda recalled Kathy drinking and then disappearing with whatever boy took an interest in her.",
    "Kathy would later brag about these exploits, but Linda was alarmed by Kathy's abandon and apparent heedlessness.",
    "\"She was sort of self-destructive,\" Linda said.",
    "I. Lenox itself merged with Birch Wathen in 1989 and is now the Birch Wathen Lenox School; the building became the home of the New York School of Design in 1993.",
    "II.",
    "In another instance of Acker's poor spelling or faulty memory, she typically misspells Muller as Mueller in her books.",
    "IN 1973, ACKER WROTE TWO books, Rip-off Red, Girl Detective and The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula, which sketched variations on an origin story that appears often in her work.",
    "In Rip-off Red, Acker includes several near-autobiographical paragraphs, such as this one: \"My mother tells me my 'father' isn't my real father: my real father left her when she was three months pregnant and wanted nothing to do with me, ever.",
    "This husband has adopted me.",
    "That's all she tells me.",
    "I feel happy that none of my adopted father's blood is in me.\"",
    "Acker suggests that this revelation occurred when she was eight years old, but according to her sister Wendy at least, this happened in somewhat different circumstances, when Kathy was thirteen.",
    "Sometime in the summer of 1960, the Alexanders were, as usual, vacationing in Atlantic Beach.",
    "Though Claire always tried to keep Bud's detested family away from hers, Bud's sister, Karen, and her daughter were also visiting.",
    "Earlier, somehow, the daughter had learned the truth about Kathy's parentage and had let Kathy in on the secret.",
    "Predictably, Kathy was shocked, then furious.",
    "As soon as she could, during dinner, she picked a fight with Bud, and when he tried to discipline her, she jumped up and screamed at him: \"You're not my real father!",
    "You can't tell me what to do!\"",
    "Wendy watched the scene, aghast.",
    "\"Obviously, this was the wrong way to find out,\" she said decades later.",
    "\"It had to be tough, really tough.",
    "It had a real impact on Kathy.\"",
    "Indeed, it's difficult to overstate the gravity of this moment.",
    "Kathy's life was instantly capsized.",
    "She wasn't who she thought she was.",
    "But who was she?",
    "Who was her family?",
    "Why had her mother withheld this information from her?",
    "Claire had been abandoned but Kathy now knew that she had been abandoned too\u2014before she was even born.",
    "To make matters worse, once the story was out, Claire also refused to tell Kathy who exactly her birth father was.",
    "She wouldn't talk about it.",
    "Bud had officially adopted her, Claire said; he was Kathy's real father.",
    "The identity of her birth father didn't matter.",
    "For Kathy, who despised Bud and who felt that Claire actually did too, this was wrong, impossible, and cruel.",
    "Many children think that their parents don't understand them, or that they are simply not like them.",
    "Others believe, or fantasize, that they have literally been born into the wrong family.",
    "Kathy's cousin, Pooh Kaye, thought this definitely applied to Kathy: \"She was like a cuckoo in the wrong nest.",
    "She landed in the wrong place.\"",
    "Such children must, therefore, they believe, be adopted\u2014that would explain their alienation from the people they are supposed to love, who are supposed to love them.",
    "Their real families, the ones they're related to by blood\u2014they must be more interesting and impressive, wealthier, more significant, than the one they've been burdened with.",
    "Suddenly, this fantasy became real for Kathy.",
    "Throughout her adolescence and early twenties, she would speculate, sometimes wildly, about her true patrimony.",
    "\"I began to think about my father,\" Acker wrote in a later notebook, \"the one who made my mother pregnant.",
    "If he's alive, he'll treat me kindly.",
    "Why I have no reason to think this.",
    "No one treats me kindly; I'm a miserable kid.",
    "Why do I think my father'll treat me kindly (my mother didn't teach me this: she hates men)?\"",
    "At the same time, the knowledge that her real father, whoever he might be, had abandoned her, now provided license and justification.",
    "The seesaw of seduction and betrayal\u2014others', but also her own\u2014that characterized her childhood would now also shape many of her future personal and professional relationships.",
    "This fact also immediately lent her life a literary shape.",
    "At times, she seemed to have felt that ichor coursed through her veins; at many others, she considered herself unwanted, rejected.",
    "In both interviews and her fiction, then, she cast her beginnings as equal parts Hansel and Gretel, Moll Flanders, and Electra.",
    "Jean Genet, modern literature's most famous foundling, became her idol.",
    "Rimbaud, himself forsaken by his father and raised by an authoritarian mother, became the subject of Acker's 1990 novel In Memoriam to Identity.",
    "Fictional orphans and near orphans\u2014Jane Eyre, Pip, Jim Hawkins, Huckleberry Finn\u2014would provide additional inspiration and models.",
    "\"Kathy always struck me as somebody who was living in raw mythology,\" said her friend the comic book writer Alan Moore.",
    "\"I think she experienced the events in her life in mythological terms; that this was sometimes to the detriment of her emotional relationships; but that nevertheless it was the essential fuel that powered her writing and her personality.\"",
    "Everything seemed to change in this instant at Atlantic Beach.",
    "Kathy was, in effect, reborn.",
    "Her relationship with Claire, increasingly strained, fell apart.",
    "They fought constantly, and Kathy began to defy her mother any way she could.",
    "During the week, Kathy and Wendy wore their school uniforms, but even on weekends Claire forbade the girls to wear blue jeans.",
    "Kathy nonetheless stashed a pair in the apartment building's garbage room, and before going out, would sneak in there to change.",
    "She started to smoke and taught her cousins how to do so too.",
    "\"Growing up, she was the apple of my parents' eye,\" Wendy said.",
    "\"Then, all of a sudden, she started changing, getting her own mind.",
    "She just became determined that she was going to do what she wanted to do.\"",
    "And, again, Kathy sought solace in books.",
    "In I become Jane Eyre who rebelled against every one, an abandoned project that she likely intended to become an additional Black Tarantula book, she writes: \"I remember: the first time I remember exerting control over my being I decided to follow the things said in my books rather than my parents' hints and instructions.",
    "When I felt anxious doing experiencing something new, if I could find a precedent for the event in a book I liked I kept doing thinking feeling whatever.\"",
    "Many books, of course, contained romance and sex, and it was here that Kathy most flagrantly rebelled.",
    "According to Kathy, Claire told her very little about sex, and what information she did impart was bizarre and inappropriate: That \"petting\" wasn't that bad, but that Kathy still shouldn't do it because it led to other things.",
    "That her menstrual blood was carrot or tomato juice.",
    "That Bud's penis was too small.",
    "As with Claire's behavior during Kathy's childhood, her having actually made these claims is impossible to verify, but their consistent repetition in Acker's fiction, notebooks, and correspondence suggest at least a kernel of truth.",
    "Acker later claimed she barely even knew any boys until the eighth grade, but from thirteen or fourteen on, she started making up for lost time.",
    "In both Rip-off Red and The Childlike Life, Acker writes, in the sub-section titled \"Age 13\": \"I fuck and find out my mother's been lying.",
    "I know my mother lies about everything.",
    "We outwardly hate each other.\"",
    "Two decades later, in a letter to her friend, the English writer Glenda George, Acker recounted that first sexual experience in exacting detail.",
    "Kathy was dating, she said, a fourteen-year-old boy named Dale Hemmerdinger, a student at the posh Riverdale Country School and the scion of a prominent real estate development family.",
    "In one of the buildings the Hemmerdingers owned, Dale had his own private apartment, one floor below his parents, where he would throw wild parties free of parental supervision.",
    "Possibly at one of these parties, or on a separate date, according to Acker, Hemmerdinger seduced her.",
    "Retrospectively, at least, the encounter was confusing, pleasurable, and illuminating, all at once:             \u2026 he's holding me like a baby and the fingers are inside my cunt and the next date or two dates later I don't remember I don't remember anything he's laying on top of me and rubbing and I like that a lot cause it makes me feel warm and we've got our clothes off and I'm sick of not doing things why I shouldn't do them I don't know and they feel so good and then he sticks this thing in me and I don't like it at all it doesn't hurt but it's uncomfortable and I can't figure out why he's doing it but it doesn't take too long and then he goes back to the cuddling so I figure if he has to do this weird stick-in thing so he'll do what I like that's O.K.",
    "and that night I go home and figure out while I'm lying in my bed that that's what fucking was somehow in my confused mind I thought men and women had babies by rubbing asses and sort of shitting together, it was confused, and my mother wanting to be WASP didn't tell me anything\u2026 Hemmerdinger, who would go on to become a developer himself, as well as chair of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, had no recollection of these liaisons and barely any of Kathy herself.",
    "He did acknowledge that he dated girls from Lenox; in fact, he married one, Elizabeth Gould, who was in a class ahead of Kathy.",
    "Gould, for her part, only remembered Kathy as \"fast.\"",
    "It's possible that Acker, a couple decades after the fact, was confusing Hemmerdinger with another boy; it's equally possible that she made little impression on Hemmerdinger.",
    "Whatever the truth, in her letter to George, Acker acknowledged the narrative power that fucking could have: \"Sex is terrific five years later when it becomes a story.\"",
    "Indeed, this particular episode did become a story, a vivid one, in Rip-off Red.",
    "Some details were changed\u2014here, the narrator is just ten years old, her paramour has the Dickensian name of Hammerblunt, the school he attends is called Riversmell.",
    "Acker's description of their sexual encounter hews closely to what she told George but takes on a more ecstatic tone: \"We were both giggling madly, two waves, or sheets opening the nerves twisted upward from my cunt, I wanted him to continue\u2026\" The scene functions primarily, however, as an erotic tale that Rip-off Red recounts as a way to seduce her own sister, and then even this incestuous encounter serves largely as a pretext for Red's eventual escape and reinvention: \"That night my sister and I, frightened out of our wits, split the city.",
    "My sister disappeared; I went to the coast, changed my name to Rip-off Red, started to starve.",
    "As far as I know, the police never searched for my sister and me: in New York they only care about pot-heads and political kids.",
    "I never saw anyone I knew in my childhood, again.\"",
    "Elsewhere, and even earlier in her writing career, Acker put this a somewhat different way.",
    "Sex, she claimed, wasn't in fact all that pleasurable for her as a teenager, but being a \"big tough sex queen\"\u2014that is, being regarded as someone adventurous, brave, and experienced\u2014had a profound value all its own.",
    "In Poems 5/71\u20136/71, a typescript from 1971, she wrote, \"the actual physical pleasure was of course minimal compared to the pleasure of becoming who I wanted to become\u2026\"              JUST AS KATHY WAS BECOMING sexually active, so too was she beginning to take writing more seriously.",
    "It's uncertain how old she was exactly when she started producing poetry and fiction, but 1960, as far as anyone knows, was the first year Kathy published any of it.",
    "That year, when she was in the eighth grade, the Lenox literary magazine, the Quill, printed a two-paragraph piece she entitled \"Night.\"",
    "Less prose poem than vignette or sketch, thick with atmospheric description, it's set in a decaying English fishing village at an indeterminate time.",
    "In it, a young vagrant\u2014variously, \"a pitiful lad,\" \"a pathetic youth,\" \"the ragged creature,\" \"the debilitated youth\"\u2014starving and despondent, drowns himself in the \"waves that had been a mother to him for as long as he could remember.\"",
    "The piece is assured, sophisticated, ambitious.",
    "It's intriguing that the subject is a boy\u2014already, Acker is playing with gender\u2014and that the setting and \"plot\" are so removed from Kathy's own lived experience.",
    "It's useful to remember that American poets were then enamored of their British counterparts, and there are echoes in \"Night\" of Dylan Thomas and John Cowper Powys, Kipling and Dickens.",
    "Kathy's own favorite poet was, at the time, Gerard Manley Hopkins.",
    "Many years later, she said that her teachers explicitly taught her that the English novel was the novel and that American novelists should be considered a \"treat.\"",
    "Dickens and Blake were among the first adult authors she read; they \"exploded open in my mind a visionary landscape called London,\" she later wrote.",
    "Other English writers\u2014Austen, Trollope\u2014provided a different lesson, showing how the traditional novel could reify the divisions of society.",
    "Such novels, she came to believe, mapped out hierarchies of class, gender, and species, and used language that mirrored this order.",
    "\"The language of the novel had to be proper,\" she wrote, \"elegant and ironic, even when the characters were depraved lower class hoodlums.\"",
    "As an adult, Acker would regularly revolt against such dicta, but her juvenilia was deeply influenced by this.",
    "Throughout the next few years of high school, she published one or two pieces in the Quill, most of them in the purple prose poem style of \"Night.\"",
    "In grades ten and eleven, she wrote two other poems\u2014\"Phantasmagoria\" and \"Variation on a Theme: Based on Romeo and Juliet, II, ii\"\u2014which, in their line breaks and meter, are more conventionally poetic and which won Kathy first place, two years in a row, in the school's poetry contest.",
    "As a prize, Kathy received a copy of Final Harvest: Emily Dickinson's Poems, originally published in 1961 and inscribed by her beloved English teacher Jean St. Pierre, who paraphrased both Walter Pater and Shakespeare: \"To Kathy, In whom the gem-like flame of poetry burns brightly.",
    "For we\u2026 Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.",
    "With love, Jean St.",
    "Pierre.\"",
    "Kathy kept the book for the rest of her life.",
    "Decades later St. Pierre reappears in her novel My Mother: Demonology, as a kind, protective teacher who introduces the narrator to Melville, Keats, Yeats, and The Wizard of Oz.",
    "\"Variation on a Theme: Based on Romeo and Juliet, II, ii\" is especially compelling, if only for its hints of Acker's later methods.",
    "Here, Kathy takes a found text\u2014a staple of high school classes around the English-speaking world\u2014and reworks it to suit her own, somewhat inscrutable, purpose:                                        So still the night.",
    "The moon has frozen all:  So still black limbs of trees  O'er which soar silent doves\u2014  black doves against a moon\u2014  And still these winter winds  Which seep into my soul\u2026  Tybalt is dead!",
    "How can  It be so cold.",
    "So still, so silent, deep?",
    "Yes Tybalt dead!",
    "O where  Are black-plumed mourners  Paid with icy thorns?",
    "And where  The sound of that foul murd'rer's flight?",
    "A curse on him\u2026 on him who plunged  My kinsman to ignoble dust, on him  Who trampled careless on our love,  A curse on this base pity\u2026  The night is still  Wild doves have left  And black 'compasses all;  Tybalt is dead!",
    "But I care not\u2026  Except his slayer's plight  Makes scared my struggling soul;  O Tybalt dead!",
    "That thought  Should bring new rage,  New incest to my mind; and yet,  In still of night  On barren lifeless rocks  I only fear for him\u2026  Birth's bonds are severed\u2014  Gaze with hate on my torn mind  O moon\u2026 for nought I care  A raucous fire leaves my soul,  Like winter trees,  Spent of all doubts.",
    "O soulless night  Be hushed, and icy winds; four nought  I care.",
    "This cruel live  Casts out all black and still.",
    "In an interview several years later, long after Acker had become renowned for her appropriation, she would return to this poem as evidence of both the consistency of her literary vision and its early origins: \"In high school, I was always imitating Shakespeare, redoing poems from Romeo and Juliet and so on.",
    "It's been that way ever since.",
    "What this comes down to, I think, is that I've never liked the idea of originality, and so my whole life I've always written by taking other texts, inhabiting them in some way so that I can do something with them.\"",
    "Shakespeare's play had personal resonance as well for Kathy, who was by then involved in her own fervid, forbidden romance.",
    "In the summer of 1963, she was taking courses at Trinity College's summer school in Hartford, Connecticut, a program that was open to students at the college, but also to high schoolers like Kathy who had excellent grades.",
    "There's no record of what she studied at Trinity, but those weeks would prove formative.",
    "In the dining hall one day, she met a freshman at the college named P. Adams Sitney.",
    "He was nineteen, three years older, an ambitious, snobby, self-styled intellectual, both an aspiring classicist and a devoted cineaste, and arguably even more precocious than Kathy herself.",
    "In high school in nearby New Haven, he'd formed a film society where he showed new and classic films and published a magazine that included the likes of Stan Brakhage and Ana\u00efs Nin.",
    "He even managed to persuade Jean Cocteau to draw one cover.",
    "He favored three-piece suits and black-rimmed glasses and was extremely gaunt; Kathy, he said, weighed more than him at the time.",
    "A long red beard gave him a Mephistophelian mien.",
    "That summer at Trinity, Sitney was studying Greek and was obsessed with Ezra Pound, Propertius, and Charles Olson, heady poets who were largely unfamiliar to Kathy and which he gleefully foisted on her.",
    "He found Kathy highly intelligent, eager, and \"slightly wild in a ragamuffin mode.\"",
    "Like him, she had Ivy League aspirations\u2014Sitney would eventually transfer to Yale, where he would study Sanskrit\u2014and he expected her to one day become a prominent academic.",
    "Her curiosity was a marvel to him, and he fed it with commensurate zeal.",
    "\"She was a real live wire,\" he said, \"filled with enthusiasm when she liked something.",
    "I was constantly pouring things on her.\"",
    "He gave her at least three Olson books (The Distances, The Maximus Poems, and Call Me Ishmael), and, for her seventeenth birthday, a copy of La Femme 100 t\u00eates, Max Ernst's remarkable first collage novel.",
    "Later that fall, Sitney temporarily dropped out of school and moved to a rooming house near Cooper Square in Manhattan, where he dedicated himself, more or less, to the underground and experimental filmmakers that lived in the city.",
    "This flourishing scene began with Maya Deren and Kenneth Anger and continued with Brakhage, Andy Warhol, and Jack Smith, just to name the most enduringly famous.",
    "These were fiercely independent artists who captured the convulsions of modern dance and religious ritual (Deren), who extolled the occult and homoerotic (Anger), who sought to depict visual perception itself (Brakhage), who upended the traditional star system and classical forms of acting (Smith, Warhol), who upended received ideas of filmic time (all of them).",
    "Jonas Mekas, the so-called godfather of this movement, had invited Sitney to become an editor at his magazine, Film Culture, when Sitney was still in high school, and after Sitney moved to New York, Mekas asked his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to help organize and tour an exhibition of new American films through Europe.",
    "But until Sitney departed for the continent later that year, Sitney and Kathy saw each other almost every day.",
    "He took her to movies, of course, but also to plays, including the now legendary off-Broadway production of Genet's The Blacks, starring James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson, and Maya Angelou.",
    "He introduced her to many of the cultural figures he knew\u2014Smith and Mekas and the filmmaker and artist Carolee Schneemann, the poets Parker Tyler, Robert Kelly, and Jackson Mac Low, the Fluxus linchpins Dick Higgins and George Maciunas.",
    "He urged her to read Rimbaud and Mallarm\u00e9.",
    "They frequently hung out at the one-room office of the Film-Makers' Cooperative on Park Avenue South, but as often as he could, Sitney took Kathy back to his room on East 4th Street so they could have sex.",
    "The place was cramped, furnished entirely with a desk and a bed, with a rope that hung across its length for drying laundry and a filthy toilet in the hall.",
    "Sitney eventually gave Kathy a key, though he was always fearful he'd be busted for squiring around an underage high school student.",
    "Not that the denizens of the rooming house would have likely cared or even noticed; Sitney's neighbors were mostly junkies and, at one point, the Beat poet Gregory Corso.",
    "On at least one occasion, Sitney brought out a Super-8 camera and filmed a nude Kathy in bed.",
    "On Friday, November 22, 1963, John F. Kennedy was assassinated.",
    "Kathy was at Lenox and, she recalled, the students and faculty all gathered in the main auditorium, where a TV was wheeled in so they could watch the rest of the day unfold.",
    "Everyone was sobbing.",
    "Kathy was confused, uncertain about what had happened and why.",
    "In her confusion, she said, she fled the school and went downtown to see Sitney.",
    "They met at the Film-Makers' Co-op, and there too, people were mourning.",
    "But, Acker recounted, the filmmakers in that room weren't upset about Kennedy; they were mourning Jean Cocteau, who, Acker believed, had committed suicide because he was so distraught over the accidental death of his dear friend, the singer \u00c9dith Piaf.",
    "Cocteau and Piaf, in fact, died a month before Kennedy was shot, with the former already convalescing from a heart attack earlier in the year.",
    "But Acker's gloss on these events was in the service of a more personal, romantic lesson: \"On that day, for me the child, there were two distinct worlds: the world of politicians political assassinations schools correct learning, and the world of artists.",
    "Artists were those who lived by and died for love.\"",
    "In Kathy's 1961 yearbook, below a class picture, the name of each of the twenty students is accompanied by a motto, expression, or epigram.",
    "Whether these were chosen, bestowed, or both is unclear; some are glib (\"Quarterbacks are her specialty\"), others banal (\"Laughter is the Best Medicine\").",
    "Kathy's motto was plucked from Virgil: Amor Vincit Omnia, or \"Love conquers all.\"",
    "This sentiment would become much more complicated (and, to a degree, less positive) for Kathy over time, but it was largely true when she was a teenager.",
    "With Sitney, love\u2014and sex\u2014could relieve the oppression of parents, the dull expectations of society.",
    "Despite Hemmerdinger and however many other adolescent flings, Sitney was Acker's first real love, in large part because he provided entry into artistic worlds that she was just discovering.",
    "SoHo and the Village were only a subway ride away from Sutton Place, but might as well have been a different galaxy.",
    "These worlds were at once delightful and dangerous, eye-opening and mind-expanding.",
    "\"Growing up as a kid, given my class background, my religious background, or what not, I was expected to marry well,\" she wrote in a late essay, \"or, when my parents realized I wasn't going to do that, I was expected to be a doctor or a lawyer or a scientist, and that was all that was allowed.",
    "I wasn't going to fit into any of those roles.",
    "So I found a sort of pocket.",
    "'Bohemia.'",
    "At that time, there was something called 'Bohemia' and it made a lot of sense.",
    "I lived in Bohemia.\"",
    "How much she actually loved the brash, brainy, horny Sitney is uncertain\u2014later on, when older, she'd dismiss him as a misogynist\u2014but at the time, she revered, and desperately wanted, what he represented.",
    "Sitney relished his role as an avant-garde Pygmalion, and Kathy in turn avidly absorbed his teachings and influence.",
    "While earlier she had dreamed of being a poet, now she knew real ones, and could see, up close and in detail, how one might become, and live, as a poet, a dancer, a painter, a filmmaker.",
    "In My Mother: Demonology, she writes, \"This hint that it was possible to live in a community other than my parents', a community that wasn't hateful or boring, one of intellectuals, by opening up the world of possibilities, saved me from despair and nihilism.\"",
    "Kathy was suddenly in the company of openly gay people, drug addicts, geniuses, provocateurs, outcasts.",
    "She saw explicitly how art could be created in opposition or in parallel to a hegemonic, calcified culture.",
    "How communities and institutions\u2014the Film-Makers' Co-op was formed in 1962\u2014coalesced around that opposition.",
    "Here were filmmakers who had taken a commercial, even industrial, narrative form and thoroughly interrogated and subverted its materiality, its adherence to certain dramatic structures, its creative ambitions, who saw in it, who created from it, an art of endless visionary potential.",
    "For the first time\u2014but far from the last\u2014a historic cultural ferment swirled around Acker.",
    "In a story that she often later repeated, Jack Smith told her that he wanted to build a huge dome in North Africa, where people could come and tell him their dreams, and he would then turn these dreams into films that would be screened twenty-four hours a day.",
    "She was enchanted by this idea.",
    "In her future books, she would reproduce elaborate maps of her own dreams.",
    "Acker would go on to describe this period with deep affection and gauzy exaggeration.",
    "She liked to refer to herself as a friend, or even mascot, to Smith and Warhol and this whole band of outsiders.",
    "The truth, Sitney said, was quite a bit different; she watched and listened, but said very little.",
    "She was shy, made no impression.",
    "But she was just a teenager.",
    "Still just a girl, still, indeed, usually dressed in her school uniform.",
    "What could she say to these men?",
    "How many of them even noticed her?",
    "Most of these artists were fifteen, twenty years older than she was, completely consumed by their work.",
    "When Sitney wasn't treating Kathy as a project or sexual plaything, he used her as a secretary, once having her deliver manuscript pages of Brakhage's Metaphors on Vision, which Sitney was editing, to Dick Higgins's loft in SoHo, where the book was being produced.",
    "But in her same essay about this bohemia, and obviously with hindsight, Acker writes that all of this was simultaneously strategic and necessary.",
    "This was how a young woman in the early sixties was forced to navigate the world, even the relatively liberated realm of the avant-garde:                 You know, one makes various compromises or rather, one puts on various masks, identic masks or identities, in order to survive.",
    "So, when I was in my teens, I hung around one of the forms of Bohemia, the poetry world; it was mainly guys there, a few women, but very few; you could see those women being on the edges of hysteria in order to maintain their position in that world.",
    "My position, as a teenager, was to listen to the big men and to keep my mouth shut.",
    "And I did it.",
    "That was the only way I could have done it.",
    "Acker kept her romance with Sitney largely a secret.",
    "\"I couldn't tell either my parents or anyone at my school about him,\" she later wrote, \"for he was an artist.",
    "Artists are not acceptable boyfriends.\"",
    "She would sometimes tell Claire she was seeing a movie with friends, then sneak down to the Bowery.",
    "At other times, she enlisted a classmate's more presentable boyfriend to pretend to pick her up, then that couple would double-date with her and Sitney.",
    "The tension between her two lives came to a head in late November.",
    "That month, the Jewish Guild for the Blind held its Thanksgiving Eve Dinner Dance, an annual benefit for the charity and society ball.",
    "Nineteen sixty-three was the fiftieth anniversary of the guild, and thanks to Claire's volunteering, Kathy was selected as one of twenty-seven high school girls presented as debutantes.",
    "The event was held near Times Square, at the newly opened Americana, then the tallest hotel in the world.",
    "This was a major event for Bud and Claire\u2014it would be Kathy's \"coming out\" to society, essentially the announcement of her eligibility as a potential wife.",
    "They bought her a long, tight, white brocaded dress at Bergdorf's for the occasion.",
    "Unsurprisingly, Kathy found the whole idea appalling, and though she couldn't skip out on the actual event, she did forgo the rehearsal in favor of meeting Sitney.",
    "Claire somehow discovered this and was livid.",
    "Her response was so violent that Acker felt compelled to record it in both letters to friends and in her earliest fiction.",
    "\"One winter afternoon I manage to get out of the house,\" she writes in The Childlike Life.",
    "\"I take the subway to 9th Street and Third Avenue to see my lover P. We spend the afternoon fucking.",
    "When I get home around 6:00 P.M. my mother asks me where I've been.",
    "'Just walking around.'",
    "'Why weren't you at the rehearsal for the Jewish Guild for the Blind Coming-Out Dance?'",
    "'I'm sorry; I forgot.'",
    "She starts slapping my face as hard as she can.",
    "'Whore.",
    "Whore.'",
    "\" At the event itself, Kathy was presented by Bud, who escorted her down a short flight of stairs and then paraded her around the ballroom before their first dance, a foxtrot.",
    "Kathy's date was a boy\u2014his name lost to time\u2014that she later described as gay.",
    "As soon as they could, he and Kathy left the dance, went to the ballroom's bar, and got drunk.",
    "At some point in their relationship\u2014or perhaps after it had ended\u2014Kathy told Sitney that Bud had once caught her in bed with a boyfriend (possibly her second husband, Peter Gordon).",
    "A version of this scene recurs repeatedly throughout Acker's work, from her early prose poem \"Stripper Disintegration\" to the libretto Requiem.",
    "In Acker's writing, however, the moment usually takes an ominous cast, with a Bud-like character banishing the boyfriend and then making sexual advances toward a Kathy-like character.",
    "He is pathetic and needy; he kisses and gropes her.",
    "He retreats only when Kathy telephones her mother and tells her what's happening.",
    "While the scene is multilayered, with Acker using it emblematically, her frequent return to this moment does raise the possibility that Bud did sexually assault his stepdaughter.",
    "The unrelenting disgust with which Acker portrays him in her writing lends this even more credence.",
    "The frequency with which incest is represented too, even if portrayed figuratively or even ironically, only heightens this suspicion.",
    "It's impossible to know if Acker was actually sexually abused as a child or adolescent, by Bud or anyone else.",
    "It's likely we'll never know.",
    "But she never spoke about it with friends, or in the many interviews in which she discussed all manner of intimate and personal detail.",
    "The writer Melvyn \"Mel\" Freilicher, who would later become one of her closest friends, said that she never told him about any kind of childhood abuse, adding that \"it doesn't seem that she'd keep that kind of fact from her friends or the public at large.\"",
    "But other people who knew Acker at various times in her life\u2014the poet Harris Schiff and the musician Jill Kroesen, specifically\u2014who were themselves abused, recognized in her a shared trauma.",
    "\"One can read Kathy's work as being very much the literature of an abused child,\" the poet Ron Silliman, another friend, also argued.",
    "Ultimately, though, Acker wasn't dealing with assertion or information, but in ambiguity, ambivalence, and emotion.",
    "In a way, it didn't matter if her self-dramatization was factually true.",
    "The Bud character was no more real than the Kathy character, but both were expressions of larger truths about the oppression of women and children.",
    "\"There are things that are just too bone-marrow awful,\" the artist Carolee Schneemann said of Acker's work.",
    "\"And the culture doesn't really want to accept it.\"",
    "SOMETIME IN HIGH SCHOOL, KATHY acquired the nickname Cassandra.",
    "Nobody remembers how or why.",
    "Was it a play on her name, or perhaps a nod to her interest in Greek?",
    "Or was she actually given, like the mythological figure, to prophecies of disaster that no one believed?",
    "Her later novels are, in many ways, prescient; even if the sobriquet itself didn't last beyond Lenox, the spirit arguably did.",
    "The nickname is mentioned on her yearbook page in her senior year, part of the caption to an illustration of a headless statue, its foot planted on a box of books bound for India.",
    "Presumably, the books were charitable donations, and they are alluded to again in a paragraph that describes Kathy in rollicking, sardonic prose and which predicted her future literary success:             Some people think that Kathy is a beatnik; others claim that she is an existentialist; but Kathy says that she is just plain Kathy.",
    "Whatever she is, she is different.",
    "She's more intellectual than many members of her class; she reads more; and she acts more avant-garde.",
    "She practices a studied nonchalance, taking things in her stride, letting trivial matters in one ear and out the other.",
    "Her close friends complain of her \"stupid look.\"",
    "This look is the only facial expression that she uses when she hears the names of baseball players and television actors that she cannot recognize.",
    "It is possible that in the next shipment of books to India Kathy might be added to the cargo, for it is noticed that she often has unreasonable arguments with Mrs. Bacon.",
    "Despite Kathy's exotic, but sometimes esoteric mind, she might, one day, return to Lenox, as the Poet Laureate.",
    "In the accompanying photograph, \"just plain Kathy\" does, indeed, look fairly plain: her hair is cut into a glossy flip that hangs just above her shoulders, her mouth agape in a slight, gap-toothed grin.",
    "Was this her \"stupid\" look?",
    "She's all head, all face, disembodied\u2014below the neck, her shoulders and torso have been airbrushed into oblivion.",
    "Sometimes, maybe, Kathy would have liked to have just been a head, a brain.",
    "Her body was, and always would be, incredibly important to her\u2014a site of great pleasure, power, and knowledge.",
    "She would later write that she wanted to create, in fact, a \"literature of the body,\" and she bristled against any theoretical separation of mind and body.",
    "\"When reality is up for grabs,\" she said, \"the body itself becomes the only thing you can return to.\"",
    "But she also often regarded her body as inadequate, ugly, and needy, a problem, a source of dread.",
    "It was something she strove to master and something to which she constantly submitted.",
    "Plagued by various painful illnesses for much of her adult life, it would betray her again and again.",
    "After Sitney left for Europe that winter, Kathy refocused on her studies.",
    "In her senior year, she was president of the U.N. Club and a member of the Dramatics Club.",
    "She had her sights set on attending Radcliffe College, Harvard's sister school and arguably the best university in the country for women.",
    "This was Claire's hope too.",
    "As Acker writes in her novel My Mother: Demonology, marrying a rich, old WASP was the best way for a young Jewish woman \"to travel from the school into the world outside,\" and the only other acceptable path was to extend their education.",
    "\"My parents and teachers, aware that I will not by nature marry a rich man, explained to me that by attending a top college I still kept the possibility of a rich or 'decent' marriage.",
    "If I was so evil that I couldn't even do that, I would at worst learn to be a top-flight scientist or lawyer.\"",
    "But Radcliffe wasn't meant to be.",
    "And, again, the Muller twins, Kathy's enduring rivals, were partly to blame.",
    "They too had their hearts set on Radcliffe.",
    "But Radcliffe was a small school; it had quotas.",
    "There was no way it would take any more than two students from a single high school, and the principals at schools with students who wanted to apply had to carefully select which applications they would support.",
    "Cecily Selby, Lenox's principal, herself a Radcliffe grad, decided to back Linda and Susan.",
    "The twins had the same excellent grades as Kathy, the same perfect SAT scores.",
    "And they were more physically attractive and better behaved, more obviously appealing candidates.",
    "Kathy was crushed.",
    "The rejection had even more sting because she had been excluded from the outset, barred from even attempting admission.",
    "She felt like an outcast once again.",
    "And, for whatever reason, she hadn't applied to any other similarly elite college\u2014none of the other Seven Sisters schools, or Pembroke, or the University of Pennsylvania, all of which would have likely taken her.",
    "Her lone safety school was Brandeis University, a Jewish-sponsored, nonsectarian, coed liberal arts college also located in Eastern Massachusetts, which did accept her.",
    "The Mullers, meanwhile, didn't get into Radcliffe anyway; both ended up at Wellesley.",
    "Grudgingly, Kathy went to Brandeis.",
    "But even once there, she couldn't stop talking about Radcliffe, and for the first few weeks of her freshman year, she let everyone know that she didn't belong there, that she deserved better.",
    "But Brandeis was arguably a better fit.",
    "Geographically, it was still close to Radcliffe, about a twenty-minute drive into the Boston suburb of Waltham.",
    "And from its contemporary architecture to its iconoclastic faculty, it also signified a distinct and appealing modernity.",
    "There were no Greeks, hardly any preppies.",
    "The student body was small, only about three hundred students per class, and many of them were Beatniks, artists, intellectuals, and misfits\u2014the type of people that Kathy now felt more comfortable around.",
    "Leonard Bernstein had once taught there, and Irving Howe and Max Lerner were on the faculty when Kathy arrived.",
    "The faculty's most notorious member was Herbert Marcuse, the marvelous, maddening Frankfurt School refugee.",
    "Marcuse had mashed up Marx and Freud, insisted on society's liberation from consumerism and capitalistic consciousness.",
    "An old man enthralled with the young, he was the guru of the New Left; his 1964 book The One-Dimensional Man was the unofficial handbook of Students for a Democratic Society, and two of his students, Angela Davis and Abbie Hoffman, would go on to become celebrities of the movement.",
    "He clashed frequently with Brandeis president Abram Sachar, who called him \"corrosive\" and \"biting,\" \"a rallying point in the offbeat youth movements, along with Ch\u00e9 Guevara and Mao Tse-tung.\"",
    "Contrary to the story that she herself later promulgated, Kathy never studied directly with Marcuse,I but his influence was undeniable.",
    "\"Art breaks open a dimension inaccessible to other experience,\" he wrote in his last major work, The Aesthetic Dimension, \"a dimension in which human beings, nature, and things no longer stand under the law of the established reality principle.\"",
    "This idea, that art can serve as resistance to societal repression, would forever underscore Acker's writing.",
    "Sitney had provided an escape, but Brandeis offered the possibility, finally, of complete reinvention.",
    "Going to college meant she would, at long last, be free of the Upper East Side, free of Claire and Bud and Wendy and Nana.",
    "Free to fully embark on scholarly and amorous adventure.",
    "More importantly, she might find out who she really was.",
    "She knew she was different.",
    "But how different could she, would she, be?",
    "I. Acker also claimed, in at least one interview, to have lived with Angela Davis, though there's no evidence that she actually did.",
    "BRANDEIS WAS FULL OF BRIGHT, original people, but from the minute she arrived, Kathy was considered one of the brightest and most original.",
    "Akin to her high school years, she seesawed between confidence and insecurity, but her intelligence, looks, and intensity impressed almost everyone around her.",
    "She decided to major in classical studies on a campus in which there were few classics majors.",
    "She called herself a poet, touted herself an expert on avant-garde film.",
    "To friends and classmates, she seemed simultaneously vulnerable and experienced, feminine and androgynous.",
    "A fellow freshman named Jeff Weinstein, who later became a food writer and editor at the Village Voice, said, \"She was one of the beautiful ones.",
    "She dressed hot, very mod.",
    "She looked like one of the rich New Yorkers, and that's what I thought of her until I met her and found out she was serious.\"",
    "Kathy was so serious, in fact, that she ditched the first roommate she was assigned because the girl partied too much and Kathy couldn't concentrate on her studies.",
    "After requesting a room change, she was paired up instead with an eighteen-year-old fine art major from Great Neck, Long Island, named Tamar Diesendruck.",
    "This wasn't exactly a perfect match either.",
    "On their first day together, Diesendruck, who would go on to become an acclaimed composer, put on a Robert Johnson record as she unpacked her books.",
    "Kathy was appalled.",
    "She'd arrived with her own collection of jazz records, but she had never heard rural blues music before.",
    "That didn't stop her from declaring it \"garbage\" and demanding that Diesendruck never again play the album in her presence.",
    "\"She went ballistic,\" Diesendruck said.",
    "\"She thought it was stupid and that I was an idiot.",
    "I was very hurt.\"",
    "Months later, when a male classmate, who was a blues harp player, expressed his enthusiasm for the same music, Kathy revised her opinion and never complained about Diesendruck's records again.",
    "Other women in the dorm had easier relationships with Kathy.",
    "\"I remember her being kind and supportive,\" Debbie Anker, now a Harvard law professor, recalled.",
    "\"Everybody thought of her as having this edge, but I saw this other side of her.",
    "She was motherly.\"",
    "At one point, when the sixteen-year-old Anker was contemplating losing her virginity, Kathy was one of her most enthusiastic cheerleaders.",
    "But Kathy wouldn't be spending too much time in her dorm anyway.",
    "On the first day of class, she had shimmied up a willow tree in the quad, where a sophomore named Peter Gould spied her.",
    "He was struck by her beauty and outfit\u2014a pink tank top and jean shorts\u2014and impulsively scurried up the other side of the tree so they could meet at the top.",
    "An aspiring writer, Gould had spent the previous summer in Guatemala and Belize, part of that time at a leper colony.",
    "But he was also shy and sensitive, a stutterer, from small-town Pennsylvania, and he felt that Kathy was, in many ways, his opposite: an urbane, wild New Yorker, more intensely emotional and imaginative than anyone he had ever met.",
    "But, as he would soon learn, she also loved books and literature as deeply as he did, perhaps more so.",
    "He was instantly bewitched.",
    "They chatted for a while in the willow, then descended and left campus, walking and talking along the banks of the Charles River for hours.",
    "Two days after their initial meeting, Gould snuck Kathy into his dorm so they could have sex.",
    "It was his first time, and, fifty years later, his memory of that night was still vivid.",
    "They fell asleep, and then woke again just before midnight.",
    "Kathy got out of bed and Gould watched with delight as she paraded nude across the floor, bathed in the orange mercury light that leaked through the curtains.",
    "\"Do you like me?\"",
    "she asked.",
    "The question made no sense to Gould.",
    "Of course he did.",
    "All he felt was overwhelming gratitude.",
    "The next day, he ran into Kathy in the dining hall.",
    "Tentatively, he asked if he could see her again that Friday.",
    "\"Of course, silly,\" she said.",
    "\"Saturday too.",
    "We're going together.\"",
    "They became inseparable that entire school year, their lives an alternating current of sex and study.",
    "Almost every night, Kathy and Gould shared a table at the library and read there, shoes off, their feet in each other's lap, until it closed around midnight.",
    "Occasionally, she shoplifted at the Brandeis bookstore, slipping books under her shirt that she later gave to Gould with the inscription \"Love, Me.\"",
    "That fall, student political activism, ignited by the civil rights movement and spurred on by the escalating conflict in Vietnam, roiled college campuses all across the country.",
    "Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), formed at the University of Michigan a few years earlier, was becoming a national force.",
    "At Berkeley, the Free Speech Movement was born, the first mass act of civil disobedience of the 1960s, and the progenitor of protests, sit-ins, and other demonstrations throughout the country.",
    "Malcolm X visited Brandeis in April 1963, and over time the student body became just as restive as those at Columbia and San Francisco State.",
    "In 1969, Black students occupied Ford Hall, Brandeis's main academic building, and demanded, among other things, the creation of an African and African American studies department.",
    "They were successful; Brandeis created one of the first such departments in the country.",
    "Kathy was sympathetic to and supportive of this activism.",
    "But unlike her friends Debbie Anker and Mel Freilicher, a psych major from Yonkers, who faithfully, forcefully participated in rallies, marches, and organizing efforts, she would have been called an activist by neither herself nor anyone who knew her then.",
    "She would later exaggerate her affiliation with SDS, and her books contain an undeniable political dimension, but the barricades she went to were in her brain.",
    "\"I didn't go down south and fight with the blacks,\" she said later.",
    "\"I was always on the periphery being an artist.\"",
    "Maybe not exactly being an artist, but at least someone figuring out how to become one.",
    "She was studying ancient Greek and, still under Sitney's influence, taking courses in the history of cinema.",
    "She continued to write poetry, efforts that Gould recalled as \"imitations of Sappho.\"",
    "Only one piece from those days appears to have survived\u2014an erotic ode titled \"To Peter Lee Gould\"\u2014but it's braided with the classical references that frequently adorn Acker's later writing and opens with an echo of the poem that concludes her novel Blood and Guts in High School:                                                               boy of the slim hips, alone on the windy shore  of Lesbos.",
    "what shall you dance  in the wind.",
    "in the seas.",
    "too many poets have vowed on these shores  to the dim Attis.",
    "and now  we hardly remember.",
    "too many feet have tread the measures,  dipping and rising  with the heaving dolphins,  silver on the black fish-scales.",
    "you, too, Orpheus  you were there, teaching the wild virgins  who sent you  down to Hell\u2026                           and here again, to guard this boy  in his first dance to the god.",
    "may his feet touch the penis measures  his voice crazed with the winds.",
    "O first mother,  black singer of Lesbos,  rise in the boy erect!",
    "let him ride your dolphins,  which few have ridden, down to death!",
    "As at Lenox, Kathy continued to be a dutiful, conscientious student.",
    "But more culturally knowledgeable now, she also strained against the limitations of the curriculum.",
    "Brandeis's literature department, she felt, was \"still living in the 19th century,\" and in the grip of New Critics like John Crowe Ransom, and Cleanth Brooks, who insisted that the only thing that mattered about a literary work was its formal elements, the words on the page; anything outside the closed system of the text\u2014an author's intention or biography, historical context\u2014was considered irrelevant to an understanding of the work.",
    "\"Anything too passionate or conceptual was considered from crude to criminal,\" Acker said.",
    "That November, an alternative suggested itself, when Allen Ginsberg visited the campus with Peter Orlovsky and Gregory Corso.",
    "Kathy and Gould joined five hundred other students and faculty crowded into Schwartz Auditorium to hear Ginsberg read the entirety of Kaddish, his 1961 masterpiece about his late mother.",
    "It was a historic event\u2014Atlantic Records recorded the reading and released it the next year\u2014though Acker would further embellish it in a portrait of Ginsberg she wrote decades later: \"I remember that they walked on to a huge auditorium floor, dressed only in towels.",
    "I don't remember what either Allen or Peter said or read.",
    "I remember that one of them gave the other a blowjob.\"",
    "In fact, Ginsberg and Orlovsky were wearing Indian robes and, on stage anyway, there were no blowjobs.",
    "Many years later, Acker and Ginsberg became friendly, would in fact perform together, and that evening at Brandeis, she said, taught her more about poetry than any of her previous academic training: \"I learned that poetry's only rule is that it is not about, it is joy.",
    "Poetry is all the treasures, the wonders that I believe sailors see and touch.",
    "Equal to and more than the pleasures of the flesh.",
    "That night I learned that all the dried-up professors in their dusty schoolrooms, whatever they taught, something about being a success in this culture, didn't begin to teach poetry.\"",
    "Kathy constantly surprised Gould with the vehemence of her emotions, and several moments with her left him with lasting memories.",
    "On a trip to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, for instance, the couple discovered in a quiet upper wing a reproduction of a tiny medieval Christian chapel room.",
    "Gregorian chants echoed from speakers around the space.",
    "Then, as Gould leaned in to inspect the frescoes, Kathy suddenly fell to her knees and started sobbing.",
    "\"I want to be a nun!\"",
    "she cried.",
    "\"That's what I should be!\"",
    "Gould was baffled at the time, but thinking about it later, deduced that Kathy had a very specific and romantic kind of nun in mind: a teenaged Spanish fourteenth-century beauty, forced into the convent by her father, separated from her young lover, and alternating between self-flagellation and masturbation.",
    "Kathy, he realized, was very capable of anesthetizing suffering.",
    "She was also good at taking on, or channeling, different personae.",
    "A couple months after they'd been dating, he watched and listened as she called a well-known birth control doctor in midtown Manhattan to make an appointment.",
    "Her voice changed immediately, becoming, he remembered, \"wealthier, older.\"",
    "They took the train to the city and dropped by her family's apartment, where Gould met Claire.",
    "They didn't stay long\u2014not even long enough for Gould to form an impression of Claire\u2014and traveled uptown to crash with a friend of Gould's, a Columbia student who left them alone for the night.",
    "Though clearly a product of the burgeoning counterculture, Acker was often ambivalent about it.",
    "In later life, she frequently pointed out hippie hypocrisies\u2014that \"free love\" was largely exclusive to men, that class differences went unacknowledged, that their utopias were often grounded in retreat and separatism.",
    "Later, she denied even being part of that generation: \"The Hippies were our parents,\" she wrote.",
    "\"Our parents had had the good life and had taken too many drugs and we, their children, were abortions, mutilation.",
    "The Hippies had believed in LOVE and PEACE and we, their children, were mentally and physically misshapen.\"",
    "But Kathy did revel in the era's anti-authoritarianism, and a so-called sexual revolution that, for all of its inadequacies, did unhitch sex from reproduction, did make birth control more accessible and abortion legal, did make divorce and homosexuality more broadly acceptable.",
    "When she arrived at Brandeis, Kathy said, \"it was cool to fuck because that was the beginning of the hippie days.\"",
    "She described \"prowling\" with her girlfriends for men, sharing boyfriends, even keeping a chart that detailed the sizes of her lovers' penises.",
    "\"We were really into sex!\"",
    "she said.",
    "Kathy no longer went by the nickname Cassandra, but several Brandeis classmates did refer to her as \"Lusty Kathy.\"",
    "She hung out with older students, theater majors who tricked out their dorms like opium dens\u2014mattresses covering the floors, black curtains\u2014and held orgies.",
    "To Gould's chagrin, she also became friendly with a junior named Robert Acker, known as Bob.",
    "Acker was a history major from Queens, an intense, intelligent, volatile figure who, along with a few other students, had been busted for pot possession a couple years earlier and temporarily banished from Brandeis.",
    "To Gould, he looked like a menacing, skulking jackal, a character straight out of Zap Comix.",
    "By some, likely exaggerated, accounts, he exclusively ate steak tartare, studied in the library shirtless, and challenged townies to fights.",
    "Kathy's roommate, Tamar Diesendruck, recalled him once abruptly kicking Diesendruck in the groin, for some now forgotten slight.",
    "But Kathy adored his outlaw aura.",
    "In February, when Gould left campus to spend a weekend with an uncle in Connecticut, she promptly slept with Acker.",
    "He found her \"smart\" and \"with all the guts in the world,\" but he was, by no means, as smitten as Gould was.",
    "Foreshadowing a persistent issue throughout Kathy's life, his interest was almost purely physical.",
    "\"She was cute as pie,\" Acker said many years later.",
    "\"But it was not the case of two hearts beating as one.\"",
    "Gould was wounded by Kathy's infidelity, but their romance nonetheless trundled along.",
    "By the summer, they were living together in Boston, where Gould was house-sitting for a professor while working full-time at the Peace Corps' language lab on the Brandeis campus.",
    "Kathy, meanwhile, spent her days writing and reading.",
    "Every day, Gould would bring her five or six books from the library, and the next day she'd ask for more.",
    "On Saturday afternoons, they bought cheap vegetables, chicken parts for soup, and Spanish wine.",
    "It all felt very grown-up, but nonetheless, once a week, they had to drive to Cambridge to receive a call from Claire because Kathy had told her she was living there and looking for a job.",
    "Though Gould didn't recall what Claire and Kathy discussed, the conversations were evidently painful\u2014afterward, Kathy would collapse into his arms, sobbing.",
    "Gould was in love with Kathy, but he was also intent on becoming a writer.",
    "And becoming a writer, he felt, meant going to Europe and leaving her, temporarily, behind.",
    "In the fall of 1965, he went on an exchange to Scotland.",
    "Kathy, in turn, went back to Acker, who received her, more or less, with open arms.",
    "Months later, filled with regret for leaving her behind, Gould contemplated breaking off his trip and returning early.",
    "But Kathy had already moved on and quickly nipped this in the bud in a letter to Gould that was flush with characteristic melodrama:             About your coming home\u2014please please do not.",
    "It is a form of madness\u2014madness that is fr.",
    "the gods\u2014as is love, & pain, & the woods.",
    "But then we must live separated from the gods, & problems that sent you to Scotland will rouse themselves if you come home.",
    "The pendulum has swung: away from myself to your parents, your rightful ambition, your education, your need of geography other than Brandeis.",
    "Now I appear in the light of joy.",
    "But do you want to marry me now?",
    "Is your need and/or fear that powerful?",
    "For that is what shall happen\u2014or what reason for an early return?",
    "She was right\u2014Gould wasn't ready to get married.",
    "Acker, however, was.",
    "He was about to graduate and move across the country.",
    "Brandeis had refused to renew Marcuse's contract, and the professor was decamping for the University of California at San Diego.I Several grad students planned to go with him, and Acker followed those students' lead.II Acker was still somewhat ambivalent about Kathy, but he also didn't want to lose her.",
    "As she would soon learn, he was more neurotic than desperado, more conventional than not.",
    "\"I was a little scared,\" Acker said.",
    "\"Not of her but of sex in general.",
    "People were getting abortions, people were committing suicide or trying to, people were going a little nuts.",
    "I hadn't been dinged yet but I thought, now I'm twenty, it's time to retire.",
    "Let's settle down.\"",
    "In a notebook a couple years later, Kathy would echo Acker's feelings: \"We both needed someone to hang on to for life because we were scared and made schizoid.\"",
    "If they married, she could come to the West Coast with him.",
    "Kathy had never dreamed of becoming anyone's wife, but California was exotic and new, and she would be even further away from her family.",
    "It seemed like a worthwhile gamble.",
    "Bud and Claire weren't especially happy about it.",
    "She was too young, they thought.",
    "They didn't want her to drop out of Brandeis.",
    "And who was Bob Acker anyway?",
    "What were his prospects?",
    "His mother was just a housewife, his father only a contractor for large construction projects in New York.",
    "Where was the money, the status?",
    "Acker was, Kathy would later say in interviews, a \"Polish Jew,\" and her parents, being \"high-German Jews\" were appalled that she would consort with someone they considered so low-class.",
    "\"They thought marrying a Polish Jew was the worst thing you could do,\" she said.",
    "The antipathy went both ways\u2014Acker, who met the family only a couple of times, called Claire a \"bitch on wheels.\"",
    "Confusingly, many years later, Kathy told an interviewer that her parents wouldn't pay for her schooling unless she got married.",
    "It's unclear, however, if they ever paid for her schooling at all, and most likely her grandmother did.",
    "She also said that she didn't want to get married, arguing that \"I was a certain class and color.",
    "There were so many alternatives.\"",
    "In any event, her parents' disdain did make Acker more alluring to her.",
    "In her 1984 novel My Death My Life by Pier Paolo Pasolini, she sketches a scene in which \"Kathy\" tells her parents that she's going to get married.",
    "They immediately assume she's pregnant and say they can help her get an abortion.",
    "She's indignant: \"There are other reasons to get married!\"",
    "\"You might as well tell us if you're in trouble,\" her father says.",
    "Kathy responds by thrusting her scar-covered wrist in their faces.",
    "\"Yeah, I'm in trouble,\" she says.",
    "Her parents recoil.",
    "Acker's narrator continues: \"Each time I slice the blade through my wrist I'm finally able to act out war.",
    "You call it my masochism because you're trying to keep your power over me, but you're not going to anymore.",
    "This is the beginning of childhood.\"",
    "In other words, marrying Acker was a way to start over.",
    "Maybe she could leave her childhood behind.",
    "She could create a family of her own, a better or at least a less oppressive one.",
    "\"I was trying to get rid of my parents in my mind and feelings,\" she wrote in a notebook a half decade later, \"and to have the calmness to do what I wanted.\"",
    "On September 4, 1966, the couple married at a simple ceremony at Florrie's summer house in Atlantic Beach.",
    "In one of the three photographs of the wedding that survive, Kathy looks unusually demure in white dress and veil, tanned and fresh-faced, with blunt bangs.",
    "But there's also the hint of a coy smile\u2014at last, she's about to be someone other than Kathy Alexander.",
    "When he heard the news of their marriage, Gould was crestfallen.",
    "He and Kathy had never really broken up, had never said goodbye.",
    "About three-and-a-half years later, he tracked the couple down in San Diego and showed up on their doorstep, stoned, looking for closure.",
    "He talked to Kathy for an hour, but the moment was thoroughly disappointing.",
    "She was frosty, and Gould discovered, to his surprise, that his own intense feelings had likewise cooled with time.",
    "She would always be his first love, however, and he'd always remember her with great fondness.",
    "A few months later, he moved into a commune in rural Vermont where he wrote his first novel, a back-to-the-land fantasy called Burnt Toast.",
    "In it, the narrator, an aspiring poet named Silent, takes a lover named Kathy.",
    "In the scene in which she's introduced, Kathy is kneeling on a kitchen floor, looking at a raisin pie in the oven: \"She was undressed, facing away from me, on her knees before the stove; the back and the top of her beautiful thighs were what I saw first, coming into the kitchen, and now that I was close to her I watched her breasts swing in the orange light of the fire (and the fire-shadow of her breasts on the thighs), her glistening lips, her white hands on the iron poker.\"",
    "Kathy's voluptuousness still clearly captured Gould's young imagination, the orange light he describes recalling that first night they spent together.",
    "But the simplistic fantasy he conjured, that of the hippie earth mother, was one that she would never fulfill for anybody, and indeed, one that she would furiously reject.",
    "\"I was turning around and going to the past,\" Gould said, of the different paths their lives took.",
    "\"And she was plunging headfirst into the future.",
    "She was already launched in directions that I could barely understand or predict.\"",
    "I.",
    "Several students, and the school newspaper, the Justice, maintained that Marcuse had been fired for his radical views.",
    "Abram Sachar argued that Marcuse's departure was much more innocuous.",
    "Retirement at Brandeis was mandatory at age seventy.",
    "In 1965, Marcuse was almost sixty-eight and had been offered a three-year appointment at UCSD.",
    "He chose the longer contract in San Diego so he could get an additional year of active teaching.",
    "II.",
    "Kathy and others later promoted the story that it was she who had followed Marcuse to UCSD, but in fact, she never took a class with him at either Brandeis or San Diego.",
    "Acker himself knew Marcuse and his grad student adherents, but, mainly because of scheduling, he had never studied with the philosopher either.",
    "UCSD was attractive to Acker not because of Marcuse but because it was cheap, easy to get into, and he simply wanted a school to hole up in, as he put it, \"until the Vietnam War blew over.\"",
    "THE NEWLYWEDS IMMEDIATELY HEADED STRAIGHT to San Diego.",
    "Acker started grad school and Kathy continued her undergraduate studies, now in the literature department since UCSD didn't offer classics per se.",
    "Tuition in California was \"half-nothing,\" as Acker put it, \"and the faucet was open.\"",
    "The war in Vietnam was still on and he was happy to wait it out studying by the ocean.",
    "They found a cheap, two-story bungalow in Del Mar, a beach town on the northern edge of the city.",
    "UCSD was only officially six years old by then, with close to six hundred students and 150 faculty members.",
    "Located in the hilly, affluent seaside neighborhood of La Jolla, about fifteen miles north of downtown San Diego, it had been established as one of the world's preeminent scientific research institutions, with an emphasis on oceanography.",
    "But the school's fine arts and humanities departments also grew quickly, and its philosophy department became the school's first functioning non-science graduate program.",
    "Over the next few years, a number of cultural pioneers would become instructors there: the conceptual artists John Baldessari and Allan Kaprow (creator of the \"Happening\"), the composer Pauline Oliveros (who, infamously, taught courses in Tarot and Indian cooking out of her home), and the iconoclastic film critic and painter Manny Farber.",
    "Marcuse settled in relatively well.",
    "The poet David Antin, who arrived that same year, remembered him as a \"sparkling and provocative figure in the philosophy department,\" who would wander down La Jolla Boulevard with his hands behind his back like \"he was in some beautiful German city peering longingly into bakery windows.\"",
    "He would walk down La Jolla because it was the only street; there were no real streets in San Diego, or at least no street life.",
    "On the one hand, it could feel like the Wild West, but it was also a dull, homogenous, racist, deeply conservative city.",
    "Marcuse received at least one death threat from the Ku Klux Klan in 1968, and later, under pressure from the likes of the John Birch Society, the school's chancellor would try to force him out by introducing an arbitrary mandatory retirement policy.",
    "When Marcuse lured his best-known student, Angela Davis, out to UCSD for grad school, she recalled that when she first arrived, \"it was weeks before I even saw another Black person.\"",
    "Bob Acker remembered being on a Greyhound bus, commuting to La Jolla, when news of Martin Luther King's assassination was announced; his fellow passengers erupted in joy.",
    "\"San Diego was not only the furthest westmost place in the country,\" Antin said, \"it was also the furthest rightmost place in the country.\"",
    "But the overall political atmosphere of the place didn't often intrude on the Ackers' respective consciousnesses.",
    "Physically, at least, it was a beautiful and comfortable place to live.",
    "Any culture shock they might have experienced was softened by a cocoon that they formed around themselves.",
    "\"It was delightful,\" Acker said.",
    "\"I was in the water, out of the water, in the water.",
    "The air temperature was always seventy degrees, the water temperature was always seventy degrees.\"",
    "Acker made about three hundred dollars a month as a teaching assistant, more than enough to cover their expenses.",
    "Once Kathy married, her parents more or less stopped supporting her, and she supplemented Acker's income with small grants and what little she could make as an occasional TA herself.",
    "When they weren't at the beach, they hung out with Acker's fellow grad students, swimming, studying, partying.",
    "He and Kathy played cards, Go, chess.",
    "She was very good at chess and would play seriously for the rest of her life.",
    "Kathy was somewhat less enamored of San Diego than Acker was.",
    "In a 1989 essay, \"Blue Valentine,\" she recalled those SoCal days with bitterness: \"I hated it.",
    "My life.",
    "The hippy years had begun when I had still been at Brandeis University near Boston and they were now into full swing.",
    "People around me believed that they and hopefully all other people could and would only feel only peace and love.",
    "Women wore granny dresses, became pregnant, and cooked healthy food.",
    "I felt isolated in this world, as if I was pitch black and everyone else, pastel.\"",
    "Reading this essay for the first time, decades after Kathy's death, Acker accused her of an almost embarrassing level of embellishment\u2014\"her life fictionalized by her literary persona,\" as he put it.",
    "But he acknowledged that she was indeed far from happy at the time.",
    "Almost as soon as the Ackers arrived in San Diego, it was clear that the marriage was a mistake.",
    "They were probably too young, and their interests had never really aligned\u2014Acker was a student of history, economics, and military diplomacy, while Kathy was almost exclusively interested in literature.",
    "Acker wasn't particularly fond of the poetry Kathy was writing either.",
    "Forty years later, he remembered it only as \"nice\" and \"not really tasteful,\" and she, in turn, was dismissive of his feedback.",
    "\"I'd listen to it, and every now and then I'd give her a suggestion,\" he said.",
    "\"She'd give me this look\u2014like, why don't you stick to things you know about?\"",
    "Neither, it seemed, had the emotional maturity necessary for a conventional marriage.",
    "To make matters worse, both of them were prone to debilitating anxiety attacks, which they referred to as \"the hole in the head.\"",
    "Acker would often disappear into a depressive funk that left him unable to do anything but play solitaire for days on end\u2014behavior that Kathy coldly captured in the first paragraph of her novel Rip-off Red: \"\u2026 I got bored doing that Ph.D. shit and being frustrated professors' straight-A pet, especially being faithful to a husband who spent all his time in bed dealing out poker hands\u2026\" Kathy could play the hippie homemaker\u2014she baked bread, sewed her own miniskirts\u2014but wasn't capable of, and had no interest in, being Acker's caretaker.",
    "\"She expected me to be the leader of the pack, the head wolf,\" he said.",
    "\"She didn't want to be my mom.\"",
    "Nor did she want to be, as she put it in a later notebook, \"a permanent Acker cock worshiper.\"",
    "Kathy struggled from time to time with her own bouts of depression, even self-harm\u2014at Brandeis, and possibly earlier, she occasionally cut herself.",
    "In the notebooks she kept a couple years later, she often referred to \"the angels,\" which sometimes appear to be guardian angels but more often represent an ineffable, malevolent force that eluded description: \"When I speak about angels I mean that there are many ways we experience we don't have language for most of them.\"",
    "The angels could play havoc with her emotions and behavior, their presence a particular form of torture: \"the angels are making me into a distortion pulling out my eyes destroying my brains.\"",
    "Kathy often spent whole days in the house, never getting out of her silk bathrobe.",
    "She was hardly idle, though.",
    "She read incessantly, kept writing poetry, and still made it to classes, where she continued to impress her teachers.",
    "She took courses in the philosophy department, and English courses with a sweet, Anglophilic Austen scholar named Andrew Wright, who later told people of Kathy that he \"had never seen anything like her\u2014intellectually and every other way.\"",
    "She dedicated one poem from those years, \"Ode to Beautiful Women #2\"\u2014part of an unpublished manuscript titled The Golden Woman\u2014to Wright.",

    "\"Ode to Beautiful Women #1\" opens with the line \"the imagination doesn't change anything\" and then proceeds to damn, once again, the hollow lives of parents like her own:                                                               what are we interested in  Today we finally broke with our parents  the parents all over America  taking amphetamine  watching T.V.",

    "The interior was painted a kitschy lime green and pink, the kitchen infested with cockroaches, maintenance nonexistent.",
    "Bob and Kathy slept on a mattress on the floor, sat on cinder-block stools, ate at a plywood dining table that Acker built himself.",
    "But they had separate rooms to use as studies, and they did their own work there, mostly in isolation.",
    "The relationship drifted, foundered.",
    "They talked theoretically about opening up the marriage but then never even got around to the swinging they thought could save things.",
    "The marriage would prove, retrospectively at least, an anomaly in both of their lives.",
    "In a notebook a few years later, Kathy dispatched the whole thing thusly: \"Acker too straight me too woo-woo wanting a family a real wife I was a good actress for a year and a half I didn't even have to say that much which was incredible\u2026\" In 1968, everything seemed to change, everywhere.",

    "In May, violent student protests engulfed Paris, leading to a workers' revolt that nearly brought down the government.",
    "In the American literary world, John Updike released Couples, notable for its unusually explicit sex scenes, and innovative fiction flourished, with Robert Coover, John Barth, and even Andy Warhol publishing major novels during the year.",
    "In the New York Times, Martha Weinman Lear coined the term \"second wave feminism.\"",
    "By November, Richard Nixon would become the country's thirty-seventh president.",
    "Kathy graduated from UCSD that spring, and continued to write.",
    "Some of the poems she wrote during the period were propelled by the same violence and sex that animated \"Ode to Beautiful Women #3.\"",
    "Others were gentler, like \"Poems for Tamar 6.",
    "7.",
    "& 8.,\" addressed to Tamar Diesendruck, her old roommate.",
    "This trio of poems swarms with allusions to Diesendruck's piano-playing, her Russian heritage, and Kathy's own biography: \"it's raining all over the world: it's raining/on you and me: it's raining on the bed Acker/won't get out of.\"",
    "Others, like \"Pornographic Poems,\" are peopled with yet more real-life figures\u2014Wendy, Mel Freilicher\u2014and oscillate between the oneiric and quotidian, the self-serious and self-parodic (\"the murk of the dead within our fingernails up/the nostrils we have picked memories of beautiful childhoods\").",
    "Kathy obviously often longed for Brandeis, or at least for the friends that she had made there.",
    "Then that fall, to her delight and relief, they came to her.",
    "In September, Freilicher, Diesendruck, and Jeff Weinstein pulled up outside the house on Front Street.",
    "Freilicher and Weinstein had come out to California for grad school, the former at UCSD, the latter at UC Riverside (though a year later he'd transfer to San Diego); Diesendruck had followed a boyfriend out west.",
    "The crew crashed on the floor of the Ackers' house, curled up in sleeping bags, for days.",
    "Kathy was thrilled to have them there, particularly Freilicher, who had abandoned his psychology studies and was now intent on becoming a writer too.",
    "Mere acquaintances at Brandeis, they became best friends in San Diego.",
    "A teddy bear with mercurial facial hair, Freilicher was gentle, funny, loyal, generous, self-deprecating.",
    "Kathy sometimes called him \"Smelly Belly.\"",
    "They considered each other soul mates, bonding over books and boys and their mutual, romantic belief in themselves as misfits.",
    "\"For hours, Melvyn and I would listen to Warhol's production of The Velvet Underground,\" Acker later wrote, \"and fantasize about living in a society such as that of Warhol and his friends, a society in which the two of us weren't outcasts.\"",
    "When they weren't listening to Nico, they were at midnight screenings of underground films in East San Diego or hanging out on campus at the Anomaly Factory, a water tower that had been converted into a high-tech theater lab.",
    "Kathy took a few graduate classes, including a Jonathan Swift seminar with Freilicher, which the two of them spent mostly making each other giggle.",
    "Freilicher ended up staying in San Diego permanently, teaching writing at UCSD and publishing cerebral, fizzy books like The Unmaking of Americans and The Encyclopedia of Rebels.",
    "Steeped in both literary and labor history, they blend memoir, criticism, and fiction, but wear their erudition lightly: historic personages like Margaret Fuller and Bayard Rustin mingle with the likes of Nancy Drew and Jimmy Olsen.",
    "In 1974, Freilicher started an experimental literary magazine, Crawl Out Your Window, which ran for fifteen years and where he published Kathy alongside the likes of Lydia Davis, Rae Armantrout, and Martha Rosler.",
    "At Brandeis, Freilicher had participated regularly in student demonstrations, and in San Diego, he became even more of a firebrand.",
    "With Weinstein, he joined an antiwar group called the Radical Coalition, and later worked with artists' organizations, staging multimedia shows downtown.",
    "\"What was going on,\" Freilicher recalled, \"was the revolution.",
    "You'd go to class for two weeks, then you'd strike for two weeks.\"",
    "Alternative presses were flourishing, including the San Diego Free Press, whose offices, Freilicher remembered, were sometimes firebombed.",
    "SDS members served as Marcuse's bodyguards.",
    "Kathy, for her part, continued to remain above the fray.",
    "\"She was completely with the program,\" Freilicher said, \"but she wasn't into being at meetings and organizing stuff.",
    "She was more concerned with alternative lifestyles, squatters, that kind of thing.\"",
    "Freilicher was gay but identified then as bisexual.",
    "Weinstein, meanwhile, was openly gay and occasionally taught classes in drag.",
    "He recalled, with some disbelief, that Kathy had told him he was the first gay man she had ever known.",
    "Even more surprising to him, she often asked him what he thought were na\u00efve questions about his sex life\u2014like, what do men do in bed together?",
    "The three of them all picked up a bit of money modeling nude for life-drawing classes.",
    "Kathy, Weinstein remembered, loved to take off her clothes.",
    "\"ALL OF US COME FROM parents,\" Kathy wrote.",
    "\"My parents were not my biological parents; they were the poets.\"",
    "She was referring to Allen Ginsberg, but she met her true poet-parents, the ones who meant the most to her, and who arguably had the most profound influence on her artistic development, in San Diego.",
    "If Kathy had hoped, na\u00efvely, that marrying Acker was the \"beginning of childhood,\" her introduction to David and Eleanor Antin was, at last, the real thing.",
    "The Antins were Jews from New York too, and though David was a poet and art critic and Eleanor a visual artist, they would both soon redefine their respective disciplines in various thrilling ways.",
    "David was thirty-six, tall, irascible, droll, and, thanks to a youthful case of alopecia, completely hairless.",
    "Eleanor, whom everyone called Elly, was three years younger, impish, and provocative.",
    "David had attended the City College of New York, where he met and befriended several artists and writers, including Jerome Rothenberg, Robert Kelly, and Elly (then Eleanor Fineman).",
    "He wrote criticism and poetry and told his students that writing itself was akin to engineering: \"The technology is language.",
    "In order to invent something useful, you have to know what is needed now, but also you have to know the present state of the technology.\"",
    "In 1966, he received a master's in linguistics from NYU, and a year later, he served as the curator of Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art, before UCSD hired him as an assistant professor in the visual arts department.",
    "At UCSD, he taught critical studies and ran their art gallery.",
    "It was a good time to go: Elly thought New York had become dull and stifling, and Southern California seemed ripe with possibility.",
    "It was more financially advantageous too\u2014at UCSD, David would get paid twice what he had received at NYU.",
    "\"People told me it was a group of scientists standing with an open checkbook under a palm tree,\" he later said.",
    "At City College, Elly had majored in creative writing and minored in art, while studying acting and philosophy in her free time, a combination of pursuits that led to a career of uncommon versatility and originality.",
    "Though she made paintings, sculpture, performances, and video, her creative shifts and the unclassifiable, capacious work led her, most often, to be labeled a conceptual artist.",
    "She thought that contemporary art could, and should, include different modes of personal exploration, fantasy, autobiography (and false autobiography).",
    "In a 1974 essay, \"An Autobiography of the Artist as an Autobiographer,\" she called herself \"a post-conceptual artist concerned with the nature of human reality, specifically with the transformational nature of the self.\"",
    "Her most renowned early work, Blood of a Poet Box, made between 1965 and 1968, consisted of a wooden specimen box filled with a hundred blood samples taken from poets that she personally knew.",
    "Her definition of poet characteristically elastic, the project included samples from her husband, Rothenberg, John Ashbery, Carolee Schneemann, John Cage, Yvonne Rainer, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.",
    "She called these blood samples \"portraits,\" and it was a good gag: reworked ready-mades that fused art and literature even as the work interrogated ideas of originality and community.",
    "Elly and David married in 1961, and had a son in 1967 who they named Blaise, after the Swiss-French modernist poet Blaise Cendrars.",
    "In late May 1968, they drove across the country to arrive in California on June 8, a few days after Robert Kennedy was shot.",
    "They settled in San Diego's then depopulated northern outskirts, moving into a shabby, stucco-and-tile house in Solana Beach, on a bluff a hundred feet above the Pacific.",
    "From their terrace, they could watch whales and listen to coyotes.",
    "At UCSD, David taught courses on modern art, early Christian art, performance art, and a course called Strategies of Art-Making.",
    "\"He was frighteningly intelligent,\" recalled one student, the artist Robert Kushner.",
    "Because he'd published a couple books of poetry, David was also asked to teach a course on the subject.",
    "But he had never taught poetry before, and was somewhat dismayed to find that virtually all his students produced \"late adolescent expressionist poems.\"",
    "Kathy's work was a bit different, he said\u2014\"verbally more complex\"\u2014but nonetheless he soon recognized a basic and common problem.",
    "Young writers, he said, always have to confront the fact that previous generations of writers have almost always beat them to the punch.",
    "That is, if they want to write about something, anything really, another writer has already done so.",
    "So he gave his students an assignment: they could write about anything they wanted, but first they needed to go to the library and find out if someone else had written about that subject already.",
    "Once they did that research and found those books, they could steal from them whatever they wanted.",
    "If they wanted to write about desert adventure, say, they could steal something from T. E. Lawrence.",
    "The work, David said, would be in putting those disparate pieces together.",
    "Within a month, David said, his students were combining Aeschylus with plumbing manuals, and creating \"these wonderful, quickly shifting things,\" like race car drivers changing gears.",
    "It was an unusual idea, maybe, when it came to poetry, but hardly new to anyone conversant with American visual art of the day.",
    "Artists as different as Joseph Cornell, Robert Rauschenberg, Bruce Conner, and Ray Johnson, to name just a few, had brilliantly used found (and sometimes copyrighted) materials to produce sculptures, paintings, and collages.",
    "Antin elucidated this thinking in the poem, \"What It Means to Be Avant-Garde\":             and if you have to invent something new to do the work at hand you will but not if you have a ready-made that will work and is close at hand and you want to get on with the rest of the business then youll pick up the tool thats there a tool that somebody else has made that will work and youll lean on it and feel grateful when its good to you for somebody elses work and youll think of him as a friend who would borrow as freely from you if he thought of it or needed to because there is a community of artists who don't recognize copyrights and patents or shouldnt except under unusual circumstances who send each other tools in the mail or exchange them in conversation in a bar Kathy would metabolize these lessons, and soon, famously, make them her own.",
    "She didn't technically enroll in any of David's classes, but she did audit them, and, at one point, told Freilicher that she was \"apprenticing\" herself to him.",
    "UCSD was new and small, and in some cases, instructors were barely older than the students they were teaching.",
    "Relationships formed easily, and both Kathy and Freilicher quickly became close to the Antins.",
    "They babysat for Blaise, went to faculty parties at their house in Solana Beach.",
    "Later, David would bring conceptual artists like Lawrence Weiner, Joseph Kosuth, and Dan Graham, for shows or to make new work in San Diego.",
    "As Kathy had done with Sitney and the New York filmmakers, she soaked it all up.",
    "In 1969, the Fluxus artist Alison Knowles brought her installation The Big Book to UCSD.",
    "The Big Book was an eight-foot-tall \"book,\" constructed from vinyl, wood, and metal, with pages on casters depicting an apartment complete with a stove, telephone, toilet, art gallery, books, and \"other necessities of life.\"",
    "Viewers could move the pages but also move around and between them.",
    "Kathy was delighted by this literalization of literature's unending promise, of life as a book and a book as life: \"I thought this is what a book should be,\" she later said.",
    "\"It's so many pages and in all these pages everything can take place.",
    "It's the open realm of possibilities.\"",
    "Kathy became so devoted to David that, for a brief moment, Freilicher worried they were having an affair.",
    "They weren't.",
    "David only ever thought of her as a kid sister or, even, occasionally, a daughter.",
    "\"Elly and I were both very fond of her,\" he said.",
    "\"She was a very charming person, very lively.",
    "She was very interested in new experiences.",
    "She was looking for liberation.\"",
    "That seeking, David felt, stemmed from a kind of distress in her, a woundedness.",
    "Elly, for her part, found Kathy \"childlike, cuddly and sweet.\"",
    "That was part of her appeal, she said, that \"she really wanted you to love her.\"",
    "At some point in 1969, in one of David's classes, Kathy met another poet from New York, named Leonard Neufeld.",
    "Known as Lenny, the twenty-five-year-old Neufeld was born in the Bronx, and had also attended Brooklyn College, where he studied linguistics and met Antin and Jerome Rothenberg.",
    "Around the same time as the Antins, he and his wife, the artist Martha Rosler, and their young son, had moved out to San Diego, where Rosler did her MFA at UCSD and Neufeld pursued a PhD.",
    "Neufeld was rail-thin, with long, kinky hair and a somewhat effete effect\u2014in many ways, Bob Acker's opposite.",
    "Freilicher didn't much like Neufeld\u2014he thought he was passive-aggressive and manipulative\u2014but Kathy was immediately drawn to him.",
    "Neufeld was similarly infatuated.",
    "\"She was very attractive,\" he said.",
    "\"Physically, intellectually, very up and enthusiastic.\"",
    "Neufeld was hardly a faithful husband, and he and Rosler had split up and come back together a couple of times already.",
    "When an opportunity presented itself, a few weeks after he and Kathy first met, they slept together.",
    "Neufeld thought Kathy's interest in him stemmed largely from his proximity to David and Rothenberg, whom she didn't yet know but whose work in ethnopoetics\u2014which argued that the true roots of modern, experimental poetry were in ancient and indigenous cultures\u2014she found compelling.",
    "This may have been true\u2014her affection for Neufeld was erratic from the outset.",
    "She had little interest in exchanging one dissatisfying romantic relationship for another.",
    "But Neufeld, like so many of her other lovers, was also a conduit to a subculture and community that she wanted to learn about and become part of.",
    "By now, Kathy's own marriage was teetering on collapse, and the affair only accelerated things.",
    "\"As she got closer to the Antins,\" Bob Acker remembered, \"she and I went further apart.",
    "She was simply going places that I wasn't following at all.\"",
    "Acker was hardly surprised that Kathy and Neufeld had hooked up, and, in fact, considered it a blessing in disguise.",
    "He had become convinced that their situation was \"poison,\" and, still suffering from the paranoia that made him marry her in the first place, he was increasingly nervous that she would somehow \"go off the rails,\" from drugs, depression, or something else.",
    "Never mind that Kathy was never a big drug user, and then only pot, speed, and the occasional tab of acid.",
    "Soon, Acker moved out, and Neufeld, more or less, moved in.",
    "Kathy and Acker separated, and, a couple years later, officially divorced.",
    "Neither regretted the decision.",
    "\"If I thought about it at all,\" Acker remembered, \"I guess I felt checkmated.",
    "I didn't know what course of action had any promise.\"",
    "He quickly moved on, eventually becoming an attorney and staying in touch with Kathy only intermittently.",
    "In the early seventies, he went to a reading of hers in downtown Manhattan, and left after twenty minutes.",
    "When she sent him copies of her Black Tarantula books, he never bothered to respond.",
    "In an interview she gave a year or so before she died, Kathy referred to her first husband only as an \"idiot.\"",
    "She kept his last name, however, for the rest of her life.",
    "\"Looking back on those days,\" Acker said, \"the only surprising thing was that she and I had gotten together in the first place.",
    "When the suburban San Diego marriage broke up, she went back to New York and resumed her natural bent.\"",
    "BY THE SPRING OF 1970, Kathy Acker was twenty-three,I and she had more or less lost interest in academia.",
    "\"Dead men I don't want to be dead that way write a thesis on the Aristotelian 'e' flattery and pretending I'm whoever Prof. Garble wants me to be,\" she wrote.",
    "She was, however, much more serious about her poetry.",
    "All she wanted to do was write.",
    "She wanted to be surrounded by fellow writers, wanted to be taken seriously, and wanted to make serious, important work, even if she wasn't exactly sure what shape that work should take.",
    "While her relationships with the Antins, Freilicher, and Weinstein were rich and helpful, San Diego itself had started to feel too provincial and isolated.",
    "Neufeld, for his part, was floundering a bit, unable to settle on a dissertation topic, uncertain what direction his career should go in.",
    "But he still had an apartment back in Manhattan.",
    "The rent wasn't bad\u2014a hundred bucks a month\u2014and, more importantly, it was a floor above the apartment that the poet Jerome Rothenberg lived in with his wife, Diane.",
    "Maybe they should move back home?",
    "To Kathy, of course, home had never signified safety, success, or comfort, but this would be different\u2014it would be the first time living in the city without her family.",
    "It would be the first time living in the city as a practicing poet.",
    "Even if she wasn't completely sure about Neufeld, or didn't know what either of them would do for money, it seemed like the right way to go.",
    "They packed their bags.",
    "The apartment was at 600 West 163rd Street, at Broadway just south of Washington Heights.",
    "It was a big place on the sixth floor, with five rooms that, soon after they moved in, they repainted bordello colors: the main bedroom a coral orange with large violet stars, the living room a deep crimson.",
    "They liberated some mismatched furniture from a friend's basement, filled the apartment with books.",
    "The New York City that they returned to, especially compared to slow, placid Southern California, was a forbidding interzone, at once wild and filthy, depopulated yet loud.",
    "The city was nearing bankruptcy, and, as with other big American cities, increasing numbers of middle-class residents were fleeing to the suburbs in search of employment.",
    "Danger seemed to be everywhere: on the subway, in the parks, on your fire escape, inside your apartment.",
    "Between 1966 and 1971, the number of reported robberies almost tripled.",
    "In 1972, almost 1,700 New Yorkers were murdered\u2014four times the number that had been killed less than a decade previously.",
    "The political unrest that continued to engulf the country was also, of course, present in the country's largest city: just a couple months earlier, a nail bomb in a Greenwich Village townhouse had exploded, killing three bomb makers, all members of the Weather Underground.",
    "For Acker, the city's chaos mirrored the uncertainty of her own life.",
    "\"Days and days of anxiety each day,\" she wrote in a notebook from the period.",
    "\"I hear only accounts of the collapse of the city through breaking pipes graft viciousness.\"",
    "But New York was also, famously, in the midst of unprecedented artistic ferment.",
    "Manufacturing had collapsed and real estate had flatlined, but that also meant it was impossibly cheap to live there.",
    "\"One could live an interesting existence on four hundred dollars a month,\" said the artist Duncan Hannah, who moved to the city in 1973 and would become a casual friend of Acker's a few years later.",
    "Budding painters, dancers, playwrights, musicians, filmmakers\u2014especially avant-garde aspirants with little to lose and far more to gain\u2014arrived in droves.",
    "The cultural world, or at least the one that mattered to Acker, was small but concentrated, intimate, and, above all, accessible.",
    "Warhol reigned.",
    "The Velvet Underground played their last shows at Max's Kansas City in 1970, and, in their wake, rock music took on new, unexpected forms: there was Patti Smith, the New York Dolls, Iggy Pop, Television, to name just the most famous.",
    "And not just rock\u2014over the next handful of years, New York was the epicenter of loft jazz, classical minimalism, hip-hop, disco, salsa.",
    "Just a couple years prior, Ellen Willis had become the New Yorker's first pop music writer, and in 1970, her cofounder of the radical feminist group Redstockings, Shulamith Firestone, published the groundbreaking The Dialectic of Sex.",
    "Kate Millett released Sexual Politics.",
    "That same year, Film Forum and Anthology Film Archives\u2014run by P. Adams Sitney\u2014both opened.",
    "The Stonewall riots a year earlier spawned a gay liberation movement.",
    "In SoHo, George Maciunas formed the first artists' co-ops.",
    "Six years after Sitney had introduced her to some of these worlds, Acker took tentative steps back into them.",
    "She took dance classes with Meredith Monk, gobbled up Maya Deren movies.",
    "She and Neufeld got a pair of cats, Paul and Elizabeth, which she doted on.",
    "She went through a macrobiotic phase, and they sometimes ate at Paradox, on the Lower East Side, where you could get a bowl of rice and vegetables for a dollar.",
    "But mostly, Acker holed up in the apartment, writing, reading (among others during this period: Virginia Woolf, Henry Miller, Colette, Ana\u00efs Nin, Burroughs, Paul Bowles, Joe Brainard), sleeping, and having sex with Neufeld.",
    "Acker had been a relatively impoverished student in San Diego, but in New York, things immediately felt more financially desperate.",
    "She didn't want to depend on Neufeld, nor could she anyway\u2014on top of the rent they split, Neufeld was paying $100 a month in child support and another $20 a month to a divorce lawyer.",
    "He was broke too.",
    "But Acker had never really held a nine-to-five job, and she wasn't about to start now, no matter how difficult things were.",
    "\"\u2026 a job to me means adjustment the acceptance into the real reality I'm one of the unfits\u2026,\" she wrote in a notebook.",
    "This was at once admirable and adolescent.",
    "On one level, Acker had an undeniable sense of entitlement, and the privilege of someone who, up to that point, had never needed to work.",
    "On another, more interesting, level, she also possessed a persistent contempt for the conformity of the workaday world and an already unshakeable devotion to her art.",
    "A job was subservience and self-annihilation.",
    "Writing was work, to be sure, but it wasn't labor, it was thinking, play, make-believe, magic.",
    "Eventually, in terms of \"straight\" jobs, she would pick up part-time secretarial work and model for art classes, but she would never take anything that really disrupted the writing life she was trying to build\u2014one that, for all of its precarity and uncertainty, provided at least a satisfying degree of autonomy.",
    "\"I've spent the last four years of my life deciding the way in which I get money by refusing to do anything that would not let me over-sleep,\" she wrote, deadpan.",
    "Neufeld didn't want to work either, or even really write that much; at twenty-seven, his greatest enthusiasm was reserved for sex.",
    "The libidinous freedom that Neufeld and Acker had granted each other in San Diego continued in Manhattan, and they both took advantage of it, though Neufeld far more frequently, and with far less anxious ardor.",
    "While Acker would have flings with various men and women and insisted on at least her right to promiscuity (\"I must at all times have the same freedom a man would have,\" she wrote), sex had started to become extremely painful for her.",
    "Within weeks of arriving in New York, she was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a chronic infection of the reproductive system that's often a complication of chlamydia and gonorrhea.",
    "She sometimes dulled the pain with synthetic opium and Nembutal (medication that required yet more money), but the infection would persist for several years.",
    "\"I was very sick,\" she later wrote a friend.",
    "\"I had almost died.\"",
    "In a manuscript titled Poems 5/71\u20136/71, a single paragraph summarizes both her horrific health problems and the grim care she received (or didn't receive):             I'm hemorraghing again today a week now Lenny fucked me last night I might have had a cyst that broke some doctor's talking about a health plan based on a desire for life and for the saving of life which no one in this country's going to want my right side now hurts around the ovary and I've almost fainted three times today in the last year every organ in my abdomen has been infected I had been told to take ampicillin by a richy doctor and fucked my intestines up a month ago started taking birth control pills again I immediately got a breast infection only nursing mothers are supposed to get then the hemorraghing the so-called doctor says no reason to stop taking the pills Lenny calls up why don't you call a doctor so I can get fucked up some more: stories about the death of the poor When Acker reached out to Claire for help, financial or otherwise, she claimed that Claire rebuffed her every time.",
    "In a notebook, Acker writes that she called one day, convinced she was dying, and Claire told her that \"the city will pay for your grave.\"",
    "Neufeld's affairs could sometimes be agonizing to Acker, but she was more worried, it seemed, about her own ambivalent feelings toward him.",
    "Did she really love him, or was she just using him?",
    "Acker was terrified of becoming like Claire, trapped by economic necessity in a loveless relationship, and made crueler and more hostile for it.",
    "At some point, and to Neufeld's displeasure, she cut her hair into the quasi buzz-cut she would keep (with obsessive stylistic variation) for the rest of her life.",
    "It was obviously a small way to assert some agency over her own body and appearance and a denial of feminine beauty standards of the day.",
    "But ironically\u2014or intentionally?\u2014the style made her look even more like her mother.",
    "At the same time, Acker fretted, in frequent bouts of self-loathing, about Neufeld's feelings for her.",
    "On page 64 of one of her notebooks (undated but likely from 1971), she wrote the sentence \"do you love me\" eight times over.",
    "It was a question she asked of many people in her life.",
    "Contact with her family remained infrequent and frustrating.",
    "According to Acker, they refused to give her money to pay for her medication (\"they pissed on me when I was sick\").",
    "When Bud had a heart attack, Claire told Acker that she had caused it.",
    "\"\u2026 I'm going to deal with them by not dealing with them,\" she wrote, \"there are no more parents\u2026\" Nana, for her part, wasn't in Acker's good books either, demanding a certain supplication: \"\u2026 my goddamn grandmother just sent me a valentine's card saying call me I should lick her ass\u2026\" She turned instead to the Rothenbergs, looking, it seemed, for them to fill the parental role the Antins had.",
    "Well, at least Jerry.",
    "Diane, an anthropologist and writer herself, had little patience for Acker, who she remembered as \"extremely self-absorbed and vain.\"",
    "But Jerry thought she was bright, adventurous, and attractive.",
    "He hired her and Neufeld to copyedit his anthology of Native American prose, Shaking the Pumpkin, and to serve as model/actors for his artist's book, Esther K. Comes to America (1931).",
    "Occasionally, Acker and Neufeld would babysit the Rothenbergs' young son, Matthew.",
    "They hung out with the couple's more interesting friends, poets like Jackson Mac Low and Diane Wakoski.",
    "The Rothenbergs were about fifteen years older than Acker, and, like the Antins, showed how a couple might make a rich and creative life together.",
    "Despite the age difference, Acker often felt attracted to Jerry, even confiding in her notebooks that she was actually in love with and wanted to sleep with him.",
    "Though more often, she recognized him as a mentor and, unwilling to upset his marriage, stifled her desire.",
    "In one of her notebooks, Diary 1, she writes, \"I don't know how to put down my feelings about Jerry very upset since I speak to few people none as fully as him though that's not fully at the point when I could go closer to someone I feel abstracted scared?",
    "I feel like I've been to bed with Jerry it's stupid to pretend that's fantasy because it's literal truth (though not now).\"",
    "After the Rothenbergs left New York for San Diego in January 1971, Acker sent these pages to Jerry, with an accompanying letter that contained a half-hearted apology\u2014\"please excuse the personal stuff I should have talked about it to you before this but I didn't know of course I have no intention of publishing or publicizing any of this that could hurt anyone without full permission etc.?",
    "do I have such?\"",
    "There was also a hint of her growing ambition\u2014in the same letter, she asked if she could use his name as a reference if she submitted the work to the Dial Press.",
    "Jerry also brought Acker to the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery at East 10th and Second Avenue.",
    "The Poetry Project, cofounded by the poet and translator Paul Blackburn, was arguably the most significant forum for American poetry in the twentieth century.",
    "St. Mark's Church had a long history of social activism and support for the arts.",
    "Throughout the 1960s, it was home to free jazz concerts, screenings of banned underground films, and experimental theater workshops.",
    "Blackburn read solo at the Project's first official event on September 22, 1966; a month later, Lawrence Ferlinghetti read to an audience of twelve hundred people, with five hundred turned away at the door.",
    "The community that gathered at the Project was fractious, incestuous, and eclectic, comprising loose- and tight-knit gangs of poets that would later be labeled Beats, New York School, Deep Image, Black Mountain.",
    "At the time, regular participants and audience members comprised a pantheon of innovative American poets: Rothenberg, Diane Wakoski, Robert Creeley, Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, John Ashbery, Anne Waldman, Charles Bernstein, and Ron Padgett.",
    "The Project dissolved the oft-mundane concept of the poetry reading, staging day-long, celebrity-studded marathon events and multimedia bacchanalias like the one John Giorno hosted in 1969, complete with fog and light machines, music, acid-spiked punch, and hundreds of joints.",
    "\"The Poetry Project burns like red hot coal in New York's snow,\" Ginsberg said.",
    "In Acker's early writing life, it provided a similar heat, as well as regular inspiration and solidarity.",
    "It was a place where she developed the early style that characterizes her first published works, where she experimented with and cultivated different voices and registers, where she finally, openly, declared herself a poet in front of people other than her friends and lovers: \"by reading these poems relations of emotions publicly I assert their worth my blood the way in which I live reading them publicly is the complement to this private writing down and is a complete act\u2026\" Sometime in the late 1960s, though probably even earlier, Acker began to keep regular, voluminous notebooks, the contents of which provide the most detailed, sustained account of her early adulthood and first attempts at becoming, if not yet a professional writer, then a serious one.",
    "Acker often refers to these notebooks as \"diaries,\" but the word isn't quite apt or sufficient and, indeed, on the cover of at least one notebook, the \"title\" Diary is struck out and replaced with the word Poems, a putatively more capacious category.",
    "\"Logs\" might be a better term too, cataloguing as they do the steady formation of Acker's sensibility as a writer.",
    "In lined, spiral-bound notebooks of various sizes, in handwriting that is loopy and almost childlike, Acker chronicles the ups and downs of her relationship with Neufeld, other sexual affairs, her half-hearted attempts at employment, gossip about writers, her own fragile mental and physical state, her dreams, her cats, books she's reading, her thoughts on writing, compositional methods, memory, and representation.",
    "Even when broke, she usually used, as she would for the rest of her life, a Montblanc fountain pen.",
    "For the most part, these entries are rapid, raw, and intimate, a punctuation-free stream of consciousness, where one event or thought suddenly gives way to another, and subjects and subjectivities shift without warning or signpost.",
    "Seemingly factual events butt up against, or run headlong into, fantasy and dream.",
    "As in her later writing, friends, lovers, and colleagues appear frequently, their names unchanged.",
    "It was as if, now definitively and publicly identifying herself as a writer, Acker was either permitting or forcing herself to keep her eyes and hands moving, to keep writing and writing and writing, to get everything down\u2014or out.",
    "Did she have a choice?",
    "Her consciousness was less stream than geyser or cataract.",
    "The scholar Claire Finch describes the notebook entries as \"a succession of gasps.\"",
    "Most diaries are pocked with performance, half-truths, and the misdirection of memory, but Acker's notebooks are this and something more\u2014early experiments in the juxtapositions and collage of her later fictions.",
    "Acker spelled out her method, to a certain degree, in a 1971 notebook titled DIARY DREAMS II:             I want also to be able to put down on the spot how I experience each event even these words make it seem like there's an inside experiencing mechanism and an outside event because I constantly change lie forget the lie was a lie invent on top of that I want a record of the way in which I remember and distort or refind experience through time though that's my private shit since my life can't be this fascinating to anyone else something pleases me about putting trivial incidents down as they happen one by one I don't know what I don't care if I remember properly in fact I remember none of my pre-school childhood\u2026 In another instance, she wrote \"this diary is about the destruction of myself and everyone else I know as the destruction is taking place from day-to-day.\"",
    "A few years later, on the cover of another notebook, she scribbled, \"I'm not sure what I'm doing.",
    "A messy sloppy account & diary.",
    "I try to figure out what I know.\"",
    "In a letter to the artist Alan Sondheim, she describes the notebooks as \"my attempt to map at that time my total prsent [sic] consciousness\u2026\" The notebooks were a place to process the tumult of everyday life, but also a kind of laboratory\u2014how could she turn this tumult into writing, into art?",
    "She was just beginning to explore how, and why, a self is constructed on the page, and what at first seem to be pages of immediate, confessional musing are in fact a fragmentary, emotionally excessive blend of reportage, dreams, fiction, and memoir.",
    "\"Fantasy, sensorial perception, dream mixed,\" she wrote.",
    "Soon, she would take chunks of these diaries, some short, some long, rewrite them explicitly as poems, and type them up.",
    "Like other female poets of the time\u2014Bernadette Mayer, Anne Waldman, and Alice Notley\u2014all of whom she would soon meet at St. Mark's, she was taking the conversational, quotidian qualities of New York School poetry and giving them an eroticism and sense of duration and perception that were subversive and unabashedly feminine.",
    "Acker also gave this formal slipperiness a kind of ontological weight, for the reader of the notebooks the effect can sometimes be simple confusion.",
    "Where does reality begin and fantasy end?",
    "What makes a dream different from a memory?",
    "How does memory produce a self?",
    "What is a fact?",
    "What is truth?",
    "These are questions she would repeatedly ask in her later fiction and, indeed, the errant, indeterminate nature of the events she describes in her notebooks confirms what Acker later argues in her novels: that language is inadequate and truth irreducibly complex and unstable.",
    "Binary divisions between fantasy and reality, dream and memory, she maintains, are false, simplistic, and unproductive; all these different things inexorably fold in on each other.",
    "For the biographer, though, it means regarding these notebooks, to a certain extent, as enclosed in quotation marks.",
    "It means relying on these entries as evidence\u2014of actual events, of Acker's thoughts, desires, and beliefs\u2014only up to a point, and a point that is in constant motion.",
    "At the same time, the fact that Acker fills these pages with such banal incidents, and that her observations usually appear deeply personal, suggests that reading these pages as an approximate factual representation is not unwarranted.",
    "The young woman that emerges is herself in flux, and appears, by turns and at once, petulant, defiant, earnest, seething, self-sabotaging, fearful, isolated, longing.",
    "From time to time, and especially when discussing her cats or her writing, there are eruptions of elation, even ecstasy.",
    "She feels too much, doesn't feel enough.",
    "She has a difficult time meeting people, she hates people.",
    "She loves her body, hates her body.",
    "She loves New York, hates New York.",
    "In one moment, she is completely convinced of the value of her writing; the next, it's worthless.",
    "She craves authenticity while struggling to define what that even means.",
    "Above all, she is constantly questioning\u2014what she thinks, what she does, what she writes and feels and remembers and desires.",
    "Even as the entries can feel hurried and harried, for Acker, writing seems to be a way to slow down her pain, to snatch at and examine it.",
    "There are countless moments in the notebooks that are impossible to authenticate, but many others that, when pressed, release a compelling essence of veracity.",
    "In one vivid example, Acker recalls Freilicher and his girlfriend at the time, Wilma Korevaar, visiting New York just before Labor Day of 1971.",
    "The two young couples get drunk, ride bikes to Central Park, gossip.",
    "It's a welcome visit, but in her notebook, Acker complains about Freilicher being \"in his usual depressed and ambivalent state,\" and then, worse, trying to cajole her and Neufeld into having sex with him and his girlfriend.",
    "In her account, Acker bails on the orgy but then, trembling and upset, listens as the three of them have sex in the next room.",
    "Decades later, both Neufeld and Freilicher remembered a much different scene.",
    "Neufeld claimed that he was never attracted to Freilicher and nothing sexual ever happened between them.",
    "Freilicher, for his part, recalled Neufeld nefariously luring everyone, Acker included, onto their waterbed, where they removed their clothes and then, before anything really happened, quickly put them back on.",
    "Freilicher distinctly remembers Acker's violent trembling.",
    "Korevaar doesn't remember Acker being there at all.",
    "In any case, Acker wrote incessantly, filling notebook after notebook throughout 1970 and beyond, later typing up extracts that she called poems.",
    "She wrote so much that a tenant on the floor below complained about the incessant clatter of her typewriter.",
    "Writing was pleasure, possibility, perversion; she was devoted to it, obsessed with it, addicted to it\u2014\"this writing is getting to be like junk I'm going crazy doing it want more.\"",
    "When she wanted to show Freilicher just how much writing meant to her, she drew a circle and said, \"This is the area of freedom\u2014writing.\"",
    "Then she'd point outside the circle and say, \"This is the world.\"",
    "(She made similar claims in other places, including in her novel I Dreamt I Was a Nymphomaniac!",
    ": Imagining: \"This is the realm of complete freedom: I can put down anything.\")",
    "But in the pages of these notebooks, \"writing\" and \"the world\" form something more like a Venn diagram\u2014the two overlap, creating something altogether new.",
    "Writing, for her, was alchemical, the freedom to rearrange and reimagine the world.",
    "Even decades later, in a letter to the film theorist Peter Wollen, another writer and friend, she still held on to her belief in the transformative liberation of writing: \"\u2026 it's only one fucking life one life to do everything to do everything to the hilt.",
    "I am stupidly romantic, and writing is one way, no possibility left of hiding lying keeping shut.",
    "I don't like being in pain, but I'll take pain any day over prison.",
    "Every day what writing for me is my fight against the prison\u2026\" I.",
    "Given Bob Acker's almost complete absence from the remainder of this book, \"Acker\" refers to Kathy Acker here and hereafter.",
    "BRANDEIS, BOB ACKER, AND SAN Diego had allowed Acker to ostensibly shed much of her Sutton Place background.",
    "Coming back to New York with Neufeld let her break, for the most part, the new bonds\u2014marriage, the academy\u2014that she'd acquired out in the world.",
    "She wanted to go even further.",
    "As she put in Rip-off Red, Girl Detective, the novel she'd start working on a couple years later, she was ready to descend \"to the more interesting depths.\"",
    "About five months after they had been back, Neufeld came across an ad in the Village Voice, placed by Robert Wolfe Studios, which was looking for actors for pornographic films.",
    "Throughout the sixties and seventies, Robert Wolfe, more commonly known as Bob Wolfe, produced thousands of silent, B&W 8mm film loops, so-called fuck films that were shown in peep show booths.",
    "The peeps themselves were an innovation pioneered by Wolfe's boss Marty Hodas, a vending machine operator who had the idea in 1966 to outfit old coin-operated movie machines with loops that showed the kind of frontal nudity then commercially unavailable in New York.",
    "He then distributed the machines to the rapidly proliferating adult bookstores in Times Square.",
    "With Wolfe, Hodas became a zealous producer and distributor of such films himself\u2014he was called \"King of the Peeps\" or \"Lord of the Loops\"\u2014and he began buying up leases on storefronts up and down 42nd Street and Eight Avenue, converting former camera shops and pinball arcades into porn bookstores and peeps.",
    "The King of the Peeps was also a loathsome human being\u2014sexist, temperamental, violent.",
    "He beat his wife and children so badly that the family dog pissed the floor every time he came into the house.",
    "Bankrolled allegedly by the mob, which he consistently denied, Hodas also soon came to own several profitable movie theaters in the Deuce, whose screens he quickly dedicated to hardcore porn.",
    "While Wolfe worked with future stars of the industry like Linda Lovelace, his actors were mostly amateurs: young, attractive, horny hippies out to make a quick buck, usually $75 to $100 a film.",
    "Neufeld was intrigued by the possibility\u2014\"It felt adventurous and exciting and a way to have more sex,\" he recalled.",
    "So was Acker.",
    "To her, porn could be performance, material, and experience, all of which would feed her writing.",
    "They soon headed down to Wolfe's 14th Street basement studio, which turned out to be a cramped, fetid place furnished only with a stained bed.",
    "The films were made mostly at Wolfe's place, but on at least one occasion, Acker and Neufeld shot films for another producer in their own apartment.",
    "At the latter, another pal of Rothenberg's, a baby-faced photographer from Long Island named Larry Fink, dropped by to take some pictures.",
    "He was a few years older than Neufeld, a disciple of Lisette Model's and a colleague of Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand.",
    "While later better known as a society photographer, he'd also have one-man shows of his photojournalistic work at the MoMA and the Whitney.",
    "Fink was both attracted and repulsed by the whole scene, and found Acker, in particular, a puzzle: \"My interpretation was that she couldn't feel real emotions,\" he said.",
    "\"She was so droll and blas\u00e9 that to me the only way she could feel was to abject herself.\"",
    "Fink would later shoot the stills for Rothenberg's Esther K. book and Neufeld got Fink to shoot him and Acker for the cover of his own 1972 poetry book Theory.",
    "In that black-and-white image, they look almost like a gender-reversed John Lennon and Yoko Ono\u2014Acker stands in the foreground, her hair cropped, wearing Lennon-like granny glasses and a see-through white shift while Neufeld, his long dark curls framing his face, peeks shyly over her shoulder.",
    "\"Everybody had a little vie boh\u00e8me,\" Rothenberg recalled, \"but theirs was a special version of that.\"",
    "The couple's porn career didn't last long.",
    "Neufeld turned out to be more self-conscious than he'd expected; he often had trouble performing.",
    "And for Acker, what was at first a lark soon became something more parlous.",
    "\"Kathy was always kvetching,\" remembered Diane Rothenberg, \"complaining how imposed on she was because she had to participate in these sexual things.",
    "I remember her telling me she went to an audition at a producer's office without Lenny.",
    "And you know how a producer sometimes comes on to an aspiring actress and sometimes the actress runs out of the room?",
    "Kathy didn't run out of the room.\"",
    "Neufeld's memory of the incident is somewhat different\u2014he said that Acker showed up alone to a shoot where there was no one but a cameraman and that the cameraman told her he was going to have sex with her and film it.",
    "While Neufeld maintained that Acker simply didn't appreciate this \"being sprung upon her,\" and was hesitant to say that she was raped, or even forced into the act, Acker detailed a similar scene in her 1982 novel, Great Expectations, which strongly suggests that she was.",
    "Toward the end of that book, an Acker alter ego answers a want ad and travels to a West Village basement apartment, where a photographer sexually assaults her.",
    "\"While the big man was shoving himself into her,\" Acker writes, \"the girl lay as stiff as a log and wouldn't allow herself to feel any pleasure because this was the main way her fear would allow her to express anger.\"",
    "In Acker's notebooks, her disgust for the experience, for the whole porn-making endeavor, in fact, quickly becomes apparent.",
    "She writes often of her \"hatred of men.\"",
    "She starts having nightmares.",
    "She thought she was being followed or stalked.",
    "Finally, she just stopped going to the studio.I But sex work was still nonetheless preferable to any number of mind-numbing straight jobs.",
    "That December, when Hodas offered Acker and Neufeld the opportunity to perform in a live sex show at Fun City, a magazine shop and theater on 42nd Street, they took it.II They usually did at least six half-hour shows per shift, though they were expected to be on call at the theater for up to fourteen hours.",
    "Acker was paid $20 a show.",
    "It was more than enough to pay their rent and, more importantly, it gave her the whole week to write.III The theater seated about a hundred men; the audience was always men, and often tourists, each paying $10 to $15 a ticket.",
    "The sex was simulated, and Neufeld and Acker devised scenarios and characters around the phony fucking: Neufeld might play Santa Claus and Acker an excited young girl on Christmas morning, or he a therapist and she his randy patient.",
    "\"It was my only venture into playwriting,\" Neufeld said.",
    "Their \"set\" was a lone chair and a wobbly single bed, covered with a filthy green blanket.",
    "Acker often forgot her lines and, with the shows considered on the edge of legality, was constantly afraid of being busted by the cops.",
    "Occasionally, to fill time, she would do solo stripteases, listlessly pretending to masturbate or simply opening her legs so audiences could ogle her.",
    "Acker was of two (maybe more) minds about the work and often threatened to quit.",
    "She described the job in a notebook as \"the lowest way to make the basic bread,\" but also later told an interviewer that she was \"into it,\" adding that \"I don't draw hard categories you know.\"",
    "A few years later, in The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula, she returns to these days, in a molten account that flickers between the comic and the contemptuous, horror and hilarity, capturing her overall ambivalence about the job before arriving at its dagger-like final sentence:             In one of the acts in my sex show I become a young woman who is talking to a psychiatrist.",
    "I tell the psychiatrist how Santa Claus fell out of the chimney told me I should always be a good girl I talk baby talk I should always do what he tells me I slowly start taking off my blouse and rubbing my right hand over my right breast, I have to believe in Santa Claus.",
    "Suddenly, as I'm about to kiss my nipple, I stop; I see hundreds of men watching me.",
    "I've delusions: men follow me, men want to hurt me, men want to have sexual activities with me without my consent and desire to.",
    "The psychiatrist laughs at me.",
    "The men who are watching me as I writhe around on the bed start talking to me I joke back with them.",
    "The psychiatrist tells me I've hearing delusions; I cut off my hair; I'm Joan of Arc.",
    "I lead soldiers in drag and kill everyone.",
    "I become hot: I rip off my clothes, I begin to masturbate men make me ooo soo hot.",
    "The psychiatrist fucks me we both come five million times.",
    "OOOO O yes yes that's it no no?",
    "o please o yes o please o come on faster.\u2026 faster give it to me now NOW ooo (low) ooo (higher) oooo oooo oah auahhh oahh.",
    "eha.",
    "(down again).",
    "All my diseases are gone.",
    "Around this time, Acker ran into P. Adams Sitney on Broadway.",
    "He was now teaching at NYU's new cinema studies department.",
    "While Acker referred to him in a notebook as a \"goddamn woman-hating fucker,\" she found herself still attracted to him.",
    "Sitney was somewhat surprised to find she was now enthralled with the writers he'd introduced to her as a teenager, but also appalled that she was eager to become part of the New York art scene, which he more or less reviled.",
    "She later called him and had him meet her at the apartment.",
    "Neufeld was there, but he soon left, and she and Sitney had sex.",
    "To Sitney's surprise, however, Neufeld returned shortly after and was eager to join them; Sitney reluctantly agreed.",
    "Later, he went to see them both at Fun City, a spectacle he found degrading and pathetic.",
    "\"The drama was awful,\" Sitney said, \"the acting phony.\"",
    "There was other, more compelling, drama backstage, that Acker was faithfully capturing in her notebooks.",
    "In the dressing room, and on breaks when she would grab a table at nearby Tad's steak house or a greasy spoon called Embers, Acker filled page after page with scenes, observations, and dialogue taken from the days and nights at Fun City.",
    "Much of this was inspired by her fellow performers, whose lives were more difficult than her own, tawdry and titillating psychodramas replete with hard drugs, crime, and sour romance.",
    "One of these performers was a future porn star named Marc Stevens, nicknamed \"10 \u00bd,\" and later photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe.IV She often hung out with him and his boyfriend, Mickey, the couple's frequent spats a regular source of material.",
    "She later claimed that Warhol superstar Joe Dallesandro was friends with the guy who cleaned the Fun City peep booths, and that she and her fellow performers were all basically waiting for Warhol to discover them.",
    "\"We weren't entirely joking,\" she wrote, \"but we were hoping.\"",
    "Acker had also then discovered the pioneering writing experiments\u2014the cut-up, the fold-in\u2014that William Burroughs and Brion Gysin published in the Evergreen Review.V \"All writing is in fact cut-ups,\" Burroughs and Gysin wrote.",
    "\"A collage of words read heard overheard.",
    "What else?",
    "Use of scissors renders the process explicit and subject to extension and variation.\"",
    "Following their lead, Acker took the stories she heard at Fun City and collaged them with her own diary and dream material, sometimes transposing these stories to first person.",
    "The result, not unlike her notebooks, was jagged, breathless, largely free of punctuation, with Acker shifting swiftly and deliberately from subject to subject, image to image.",
    "\"I really love doing cut up like destroying everything and making music of it,\" she later told Bernadette Mayer.",
    "For Burroughs, the cut-up and fold-in were means to reveal the codes that construct the world, to, as he famously wrote in Nova Express, \"storm the reality studio\" and \"retake the universe.\"",
    "For Acker, they were ways to think against every repression, to overturn the worlds, and words, of parents, gender, the academy, authorship itself.",
    "They could subvert the strictures of identity.",
    "They could anatomize sexual power.",
    "If Burroughs was a satirist, Acker was a kind of metafabulist.",
    "Acker loathed the theater on 42nd Street and the men who ran it (\"the shits,\" she called them), but the work and the environment provided what she, retrospectively at least, considered a productive and profitable radicalization.",
    "While she was certainly no na\u00eff, up until that point she had been a more or less \"good\" middle-class girl.",
    "Now, suddenly, she was not just part of the working class, but a sex worker, surrounded by other sex workers.",
    "It was akin, perhaps, to Simone Weil going to the factories.",
    "She acquired a new, deeper understanding of capitalism and feminism.",
    "Stripped of her own class privilege, so to speak, she was now confronting, every week, the violence of male privilege and the male gaze.",
    "If she had only ever been a casual observer of the protests that roiled the campuses at Brandeis and UCSD, here she was fully engag\u00e9e in the sexual revolution, literally putting her body on the line.",
    "\"In my life politics don't disappear but take place in my body,\" she would write a few years later in Blood and Guts in High School.",
    "In several later interviews, Acker would credit this period in her life with utterly transforming her perception of power in the world:             It changed my politics\u2026 the 42nd Street experience made me learn about street politics.",
    "It's not that I was that interested in sex.",
    "It more gave me a viewpoint of whatever goes on in actuality through the kind of sexual perspective.",
    "I think Genet has the same perspective.",
    "You see people from the bottom up, and sexual behavior, especially sex minus relationship\u2014which is what happens in 42nd Street\u2014is definitely bottom.",
    "Then you see it in a different way, especially power relationships in society.",
    "And I think that perspective never left me.",
    "This perspective was complex, however.",
    "At the same time, she told Sitney, with pride and glee, that she had become a \"whore.\"",
    "When not working, she favored short skirts and, occasionally, transparent dresses with nothing underneath.",
    "While she was learning up close how sex could be central to female oppression, how it served as a tool of control, she was also taking pleasure in exhibitionism and performance, and in the idea\u2014as staged and debased as it was in this context\u2014that desire could, potentially, be a site of resistance.",
    "The tricky, maybe impossible, reconciliation of these things would preoccupy her future writing.",
    "In a sense, Acker was slumming.",
    "Many years later, those months in the sex industry would continue to establish her bona fides, and remind readers that, no matter how close she skirted to the literary mainstream, once upon a time, she was an up-from-the-streets wild child.",
    "In March 1971, as Acker had feared, the vice squad raided the theater.",
    "Acker and Neufeld were arrested for public lewdness.",
    "They spent a night in jail, with her bosses finally bailing them out.",
    "Acker and Neufeld eventually had to appear in court multiple times, and in her notebooks, Acker bristles with equal contempt for Hodas, the lawyers, and the cops, conjuring a conspiracy of profit in which the only losers were her and her fellow workers: \"it's the ass-hole [sic] of the shittiest bureaucracy that will exist we're the ones who sit in the court became criminals if who don't show up for 12 hours each month if we don't take whatever shit anyone decides to hand out\u2026\" Acker would later glamorize criminals and lawlessness in her fiction, but the real-life hoodlums that she worked for were, she knew, hardly romantic figures.",
    "As she wrote at the time, \"I admire criminals in my head knowing they're shits businessmen motherfuckers like everyone else.\"",
    "I.",
    "None of the loops seem to have survived, but a half-dozen years after they were made, the poet Ron Silliman stumbled across one of the films in a San Francisco porn shop.",
    "The thing he remembered most about it was a scene in which Acker is flogged\u2014with lettuce leaves.",
    "Acker later claimed, half-jokingly, that this was her first experience with S/M.",
    "II.",
    "That's the name that Acker used or remembered, though the actual name may have actually been the Avon 42nd Street or the Fake; no one really remembers.",
    "In a notebook, Acker writes that the theater was the only theater in New York to offer a live sex show, and in his Tales of Times Square, Josh Alan Friedman reports that the first to do so was the less felicitously named Mine-Cine.",
    "By which he's probably referring to the Mini Cinema on Seventh Avenue and West 48th Street.",
    "III.",
    "In a March 1976 interview Acker gave to Only Paper Today, the Toronto art magazine, she said she performed six days a week, but entries in her notebook\u2014\"I'm working in a live sex show for bread it gives me six days of leisure\"\u2014contradict this.",
    "IV.",
    "Acker usually misspells his name as \"Mark,\" and he was occasionally credited as such in later films he made.",
    "V. Acker often credited Burroughs and Gysin's The Third Mind, which collects these experiments in one book, with influencing her early writing.",
    "She, in fact, considered The Third Mind Burroughs's most important book.",
    "It wasn't published, however, until 1978, long after she'd started publishing.",
    "A MONTH BEFORE THE BUST, on February 10, Acker and Neufeld went to the Poetry Project to see Patti Smith and Gerard Malanga read.",
    "Ever since high school, when she first saw his poetry at the Gotham Book Mart, Acker had idolized Malanga (and fantasized about sleeping with him).",
    "She had never heard of Smith.",
    "Not many people had.",
    "But just a few months older than Acker, she'd already established herself as a rock critic and an emerging, electrifying poet, and was an intimate of two other soon-to-be-titanic cultural figures, Robert Mapplethorpe and Sam Shepard.",
    "For Smith's very first public reading, Mapplethorpe had convinced Malanga to let her open for him at St. Mark's, and Smith exploited the opportunity as fully as she could.",
    "She tapped an acquaintance at the Chelsea Hotel named Lenny Kaye to punctuate her reading with bursts of electric guitar, the first time the instrument had ever been played in the church.",
    "She wanted to perform her poetry, she said, the way she had learned from Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix.",
    "February 10 was Bertolt Brecht's birthday, and she opened her performance with a rendition of \"Mack the Knife,\" while also dedicating the reading to \"criminals from Cain to Genet.\"",
    "She read from poems like \"Oath,\" whose opening lyric, \"Christ died for somebody's sins/But not mine,\" would also serve as the opening lines, more or less, of \"Gloria,\" the first track on Horses, her debut album four years later.",
    "Poets John Giorno and Joe Brainard were in the audience, and, thanks to Malanga, the church was packed with Factory folks: Lou Reed, Rene Ricard, Brigid Berlin, Warhol himself.",
    "For Acker, who'd long dreamed of joining Warhol's world, it was an exhilarating evening.",
    "Smith mesmerized her.",
    "Lots of rock stars fancied themselves poets, but few poets tried to turn themselves into rock stars.",
    "And even rarer and more thrilling\u2014a female poet, a female rock star.",
    "Smith was self-possessed, fierce, beyond androgynous.",
    "She reminded Acker of no one so much as herself, five years earlier, at Brandeis\u2014or at least how she wanted to be and wanted to be seen.",
    "\"She's gorgeous half male though she comes on very tough at the point of exploding into total femininity,\" Acker gushed in her notebook before, characteristically, turning on herself: \"I really like her have no way of meeting her of course I won't I probably like this being all shut in myself safe in the 42nd half fantasy real underground god forbid I should actually talk to someone who also writes\u2026\" Three months later, though, Acker would make her own Poetry Project debut, as part of an open mic reading on May 7.",
    "She had just turned twenty-four.",
    "It was her first public reading in New York.",
    "Acker read from her notebooks, and while her performance was considerably less theatrical than Smith's, she was thrilled by the enthusiastic response, especially from the women in the audience.",
    "In a letter to Jerome Rothenberg, she wrote that the night was \"\u2026 very beautiful I feel all religious all these women were coming up to me afterward and saying your stuff was really great it really moved me so I'm feeling terrific\u2026\" She realized then that she was in fact largely writing for women, and hoping that they would feel, hearing or reading her words, the same connection to her work that she felt when she read certain female poets or saw movies made by women.",
    "Women were a dominant force at the Poetry Project by then.",
    "Many of its earlier luminaries had achieved some mainstream success or moved to other parts of the country, but a younger generation was thriving at the church, largely influenced by the innovative work and thinking of poet Bernadette Mayer.",
    "Slim, radiant, beetle-browed, and irreverent, and just a couple years older than Acker, Mayer was considered a second-generation New York School poet, though her work was more overtly conceptual.",
    "In 1971, with Anne Waldman serving as the Poetry Project's director, Mayer began teaching weekly writing workshops that became renowned for the intellectual rigor she brought to them and the heterodox literary methods she espoused.",
    "Gathering as many as twenty poets at a time in the vestibule off the church's main sanctuary, she encouraged her students to read widely: everything from Curious George to Ludwig Wittgenstein.",
    "With the students, she devised a playful, generative catalogue of writing games, exercises, and prompts, such as \"Write a soothing novel in twelve short paragraphs,\" or \"Write as you think, as close as you can come to this, that is, put pen to paper and don't stop.",
    "Experiment writing fast and writing slow,\" or \"Rewrite someone else's writing.",
    "Experiment with theft and plagiarism.\"",
    "She recommended workshop participants keep a variety of journals: of their dreams, food they ate, tenant-landlord situations, skies they saw, times of solitude.",
    "While Acker never actually participated in these workshops herself, she was aware of their lessons, some of which resembled things David Antin had taught her.",
    "She already wrote as she thought, or as close as she could come.",
    "She already stole stories and images from other books and people.",
    "But she admired Mayer from afar, enchanted by her beauty and intellect.",
    "The two women, it turned out, shared a number of affinities.",
    "Like Acker, Mayer had endured a difficult childhood and had studied Greek and Latin.",
    "Like Acker, she had strong ties to the conceptual art world\u2014from 1967 to 1969, she co-edited a magazine of avant-garde writing with performance and video artist Vito Acconci (who was also married to Mayer's sister, the celebrated artist Rosemary Mayer), and Mayer's first major work, Memory, which she began in the summer of 1971, was a hybrid piece that combined photography and recorded narration.",
    "Mayer ignored the confines of genre and published everything from sonnet sequences and short stories to translations of Catullus and guides to science writing.",
    "Even within single works, she oscillated between poetry and prose, and she peopled her writing with both real-life figures and literary characters.",
    "Much of her work is a relentless interrogation of gender, interpretation, narrative, and authority.",
    "She revered Gertrude Stein.",
    "She experimented with the epistolary.",
    "She was a devotee of the stapled, mimeographed literary magazine, enthralled with its speed, immediacy, and democratic production.",
    "Ultimately, she offered a liberating literary model for Acker, and even if Acker later rarely mentioned Mayer as an influence, at least publicly, that influence was undeniable.",
    "Though Acker referred to Mayer in a notebook as \"a standoffish person,\" in December 1971, she also wrote, in a notebook dedicated to \"GERTRUDE STEIN & ALL LESBIANS\" (and subtitled \"DIARY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING\"), that Mayer's work \"touches reality\" and made her question her own.",
    "Later that month Acker gave Mayer one of her notebooks to read but almost immediately regretted it: \"she probably won't like it and I was wrong to do that I didn't know how else to get to her.\"",
    "More than forty years later, Mayer didn't remember reading that particular notebook or having that particular encounter, but she did recall Acker as a \"lively, vivid presence.\"",
    "The two women eventually became friends and later, for a brief moment, roommates.",
    "After that first open mic reading, Acker was at the church at least a couple days a week.",
    "She continued to read from her notebooks, and while the work had obvious kinship with Mayer's and Waldman's, which also involved collaging her diary writing with snatches of overheard found \"verse\" from the streets and the radio, Acker's writing was more aggressive and bluntly sexual.",
    "All three were obsessed with accurately and unapologetically representing feminine experience, but Acker went the furthest in complicating what was considered feminine.",
    "Even then, there was tension in the persona she projected in her writing: it was vulnerable, even abject, but also angry, tough, streetwise.",
    "Acker later claimed that the Poetry Project crowd was dismissive or hostile toward her, partly because she worked in the sex industry\u2014\"They thought I was some kind of pervert,\" she said, and \"I realized I'd never be one of them\"\u2014and she would tend to minimize St. Mark's importance in her development as a writer.",
    "But Mayer, retrospectively at least, thought Acker was extraordinarily gutsy, taking an exotic and precarious path no other writer she knew had dared to take.",
    "There was also a poetic resonance to it, Mayer said, that informed her work: \"Her writing was as schizophrenic as the life she was leading, going from philosophy and poetry to sex and back again.",
    "It was breathtaking.\"",
    "Waldman, for her part, came to consider Acker a \"hero,\" and said, decades later, that her writing was \"amazing, headstrong, important.\"",
    "Also a couple years Acker's senior, Waldman felt that their writing lives had been almost entwined, that they bounced off the same literary influences, and that they were united in producing neither \"left verse poetry with the usual tropes and epiphanies\" nor New Yorker\u2013friendly short fiction.",
    "\"There's a naughty, exhibitionistic girl-child at the center of it,\" Waldman said of Acker's work.",
    "\"It's un-subtle in interesting ways, revealing too, which makes it more democratic and honest.",
    "What other women were doing this?\"",
    "If anybody, it was certain male poets at the Poetry Project that may have been grousing about the exhibitionism of Acker's work.",
    "During one evening, Harris Schiff, who was assistant organizer of the reading series and with whom Acker had a brief affair, read a poem that criticized what he considered the overreliance on sexual content in the poetry of the day.",
    "Acker, who felt that Schiff didn't take her work seriously anyway, went on stage immediately after him, and proceeded to read some of her raunchiest passages.",
    "They never discussed the evening again.",
    "In late 1971 and into early 1972, Acker took the notebooks she filled at Fun City and Embers, her life in the more interesting depths, and began to slowly turn these pages into what would become her first chapbook.I Acker said that the book, titled Politics, was written under certain rules, \"rules which any academic poetry class would condemn as severely as the Spanish did the Jews.\"",
    "She wrote as quickly and badly as possible.",
    "While increasingly interested in narrative, she had no interest in traditional novelistic concerns.",
    "There were no \"well-rounded\" characters.",
    "She would not rewrite.",
    "This may have been true of her initial notebook compositions, which are relatively free of redaction or revision.",
    "(Specific dream sequences are, however, occasionally labeled as such.)",
    "But when the notebook entries were selected, typed up, and collated, Acker did, in fact, rewrite and reorder portions of the text.",
    "She framed the extracts from her 1971 notebooks with more abstract, less autobiographical pieces titled \"Ghost Story\" and \"Political Desire,\" as well as additional, untitled fragments or vignettes that do seem to also describe parts of her life.",
    "These fragments were also part of a larger typescript Acker titled Portraits, though it's unclear if she intended Portraits to be published as is, or if this was just an ongoing file of writing that she kept.",
    "In one of these fragments, for the first time in her published writing, Acker recounts the defining wound of her early childhood: \"I don't know who my father was.",
    "I don't know if my mother was married or not.",
    "I don't know if she wanted to have me or not.",
    "I don't know if she showed me she wanted me or not when I was a child but I presume from irrational beliefs deep within me that she didn't.\"",
    "This piece, which Acker titled \"Velvet Awareness\" in a different, separate typescript, ends with an all-caps pronouncement that Acker might have used as an epigraph for virtually every one of her future books: \"DOWN WITH THE FAMILY THE FAMILY IS THE WORST EVIL/IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS THE CAUSE OF EVIL EVERYWHERE.\"",
    "Acker later described Politics as \"little prose poems,\" but the central diary material\u2014perhaps because of the biographical window it opens, its reportorial snapshot of Times Square in the early seventies, or because it's littered with characters, as deliberately sketchy as they may be\u2014has an overt narrative momentum that Acker would later explore more directly.",
    "Divorced from its diaristic context, however, the section takes on a seething, and almost dream-like, texture.",
    "Politics was thirty-two pages long, including a title page indicating it was published by Papyrus Press in May 1972.",
    "According to Neufeld, there was no Papyrus Press\u2014\"it was just a name for her own self-publishing efforts\"\u2014but he had no recollection of where the name came from.",
    "Acker made photocopies, between two and three hundred, stapled the books herself, and then she and Neufeld distributed them to bookstores by hand and mailed them to friends.",
    "Among the poetry communities on both coasts, the book became a small sensation, with one poet likening it to Diane di Prima's frankly erotic Memoirs of a Beatnik, published three years earlier.",
    "Acker was delighted: \"\u2026 my desire to be seen and understood is na\u00efve but i [sic] am pleased it feels so exciting when i know my writing is in the world and not just trapped in my mind or these pages\u2026\" At the same time, she worried she might have made a mistake in focusing on what she called the \"sensational material.\"",
    "Anticipating similar struggles she'd have later in her career, Acker feared that the book's explicit sex would either give readers a distorted impression of her intentions or result in an unwanted kind of notoriety.",
    "\"I didn't want to become real famous,\" she later said, with some disingenuity.",
    "\"Not that I would, but I didn't want to chance it.",
    "Because I thought it would ruin me.",
    "It would have messed up my head.\"",
    "When publishers like Black Sparrow Press and Dial Press expressed interest in possibly reprinting the book, she was wary, and ultimately refused.",
    "\"The 42nd street shit that's only 1 part is NOT what my writing's about,\" she told Rothenberg.",
    "Even two decades later, in an interview with Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer, at various times her lover, mentor, and publisher\u2014and who would publish the sex show section of Politics in the Acker miscellany Hannibal Lecter, My Father\u2014she was still struggling with this conundrum.",
    "\"I was very scared,\" she told Lotringer, \"and thought if this gets published in a big way and people pick it up and listen to the sensationalism, because it's about the sex show, I'll never be a writer, that's it.",
    "You know, they'll put a frame around me, and that'll be it.",
    "So I didn't do it.\"",
    "\"But you have that anyway,\" Lotringer said, referring to her career at the time.",
    "\"Yeah, but I think this would have been worse, Sylv\u00e8re, I think it really would've been bad.",
    "Do you know what I mean?",

    "Politics opens with an untitled fragment, a scene really, of an unnamed female narrator having sex with another woman:             I'm lying in bed with her I touch the visible scalp in the center of her forehead then I run my hands slowly down her long and messy locks we meet kissing for a long time feeling the texture of mouths then of the skin and the position of our bones the inset of the eye and the thinness of the ears the tenseness and warmth within our bones especially within the small of the back forces us to our and each other's sex: breasts and hair and smell for a very long time we arouse each other always with a minimum of caress warm heavy breasts salty bitterness of the hair under our arms that cats adore to lick we have our arms around each other's shoulders our bodies barely touch we look at each other her long brown hair very white skin she has a thin mouth that opens wide when she smiles brown eyes I like mine my hair is almost gone my face looks long like a child\u2026 This description, tender and tame, goes on for a page, becoming increasingly graphic and ecstatic.",
    "While the next piece or poem\u2014a caustic, partial portrait of Claire, seemingly\u2014sharply interrupts this opening moment, Acker returns a couple pages later to flick again at another, possibly different, sexual relationship with a woman.",
    "The hot-and-cold equivocation of this sequence aside, Acker's sexual interest in women was growing.",
    "As Acker's relationship with Neufeld cycled through love, indifference, and antipathy, she yearned for more satisfying, and less oppressive, romantic relationships.",
    "She believed that she could find these with women and, as the notebooks suggest, started to make deliberate attempts to cultivate them.",
    "\"I'm getting involved in womens lib actually lesbians lib to be honest,\" she wrote Rothenberg.",
    "Her notebooks and typescripts from the period are emblazoned with titles and subtitles like \"KEY WORD LESBIAN\" and \"Diary: Warm Cat Fur/Lesbian II\"; one notebook is \"dedicated\" to \"GERTRUDE STEIN & ALL LESBIANS.\"",
    "A paragraph in Poems 5/71\u20136/71 consists entirely of the word \"lesbian\" repeated sixty times.",
    "In a large, brown, spiral-bound notebook, titled \"Concrete Poems,\" she filled entire pages with the words \"myself,\" \"lesbian,\" \"angelic,\" and \"holy,\" repeating them in rows starting from the outermost edges and working inward.",
    "With some nervousness, she attended dances hosted by the Daughters of Bilitis, whose New York chapter was located in a loft on Prince Street; became infatuated with a couple of different women; flirted with other female performers in the sex show.",
    "\"Liking women means liking I'm a woman,\" she wrote in a notebook, though she later scratched this sentence out.",
    "She knew she was indulging, to a certain degree, a fantasy\u2014\"hopefully lesbians have more sense I don't enter that society because it's the only one left to idealize\"\u2014and once she started spending more time with gay women, she found herself as often confused and frustrated as she was giddy.",
    "She didn't agonize over her sexuality, per se, but she did agonize over what that attraction meant to, or for, her sense of self.",
    "In theory, being gay could mean ditching men once and for all, but, as she quickly learned, lesbians had their own specific hang-ups and complications.",
    "Most significantly, Acker insisted that she was bisexual, and she was irritated when other women insisted on more rigid categorization.",
    "In a notebook entry from January 19, 1972, she wrote:             \u2026 go to gay women's poetry reading read parts of earlier diaries mainly about self & cultural destruction no or hostile response perhaps because I mentioned word \"gonorrhea\" I made them uptight because I was pushing them to be conscious of their individual strangeness (unsureness) all other women read about being lesbians & got terrific responses.",
    "Feel old confusions because I'm not sure if I'm lying by reading at a lesbian gathering I don't want to deal with my self-image the way the group presents its image\u2026 Acker would eventually find more gratifying sexual relationships with women, and would solve this problem of self-image by insisting she was \"queer.\"",
    "But for the moment, anyway, being with women did little to assuage her loneliness.",
    "Neufeld continued to conduct multiple affairs and, even worse, Acker felt he wasn't a serious artist.",
    "Seeking more intellectual stimulation, she went back to grad school, starting a joint program in classics and philosophy at CCNY and NYU.",
    "She quickly realized that academia still bored her, though, and soon dropped out.",
    "With so much in disarray, from her domestic life to her sense of self, against her better judgment, Acker took a job.",
    "After they left the sex show, Neufeld had found work with Burt Lasky, whose small Riverdale firm provided editorial services, proofreading, and indexing to various New York publishing houses.",
    "After a while, Lasky hired Acker too, as a secretary.",
    "It didn't last long.",
    "While Lasky was, in Neufeld's memory, \"a very liberal guy,\" Acker was \"a little too unconventional and didn't fit in well at the office.\"",
    "Once again, straight work was anathema, and office life, to her mind, almost as sexist and demeaning as the sex show.",
    "She and Lasky yelled at each other constantly.",
    "In her Poems 5/71\u20136/71, she sourly summed up her opinion of all work that wasn't writing: \"Secretarial work shit file clerk work shit upper eschelon [sic] proofreading copy-editing publishing work shit advertising fashion money work shit unemployment work shit ass-licking work shit sex dancing work shit Medicaid work shit rich gynecologist reporting work shit government work shit richy work shit all university so-called learning work shit.\"",
    "She briefly went back to sex work, performing as a go-go dancer in New Jersey, but was appalled again by the men she worked and performed for.",
    "She was appalled by herself.",
    "\"I'm perpetrating the domination by men of women,\" she wrote.",
    "Even if writing was the only thing that wasn't shit, her relationship to it was changing.",
    "While she still called herself a poet, she also felt more and more estranged from the Poetry Project, which she now considered elitist, and the scene there dull, self-indulgent, and insular.",
    "At the end of The Burning Bombing of America: The Destruction of the U.S., a book she started working on right after Politics, she writes, \"ALL POETS BECOME OTHER POETS SAME THE SAME LINES ST. MARK'S CHURCH IS A REVOLUTIONARY CRUISE-JOINT.\"",
    "To her mind, even the form itself was unduly limiting.",
    "Prose seemed to offer greater possibilities, creative and otherwise.",
    "But, as she did with parts of Politics, she wanted to write prose the way that poets wrote poems\u2014explicitly engaging with language at the level of the sentence, and conceptually, using what she called a \"process.\"",
    "William Burroughs, whose work flickered productively between fiction and philosophy, had shown her how to do that, as had Gertrude Stein.",
    "But there were other examples, all around the world.",
    "The effects and influence of the nouveau roman, as conceived by writers like Alain Robbe-Grillet and Nathalie Sarraute, were still being felt in North America.",
    "Latin American literature was booming, with books as different as One Hundred Years of Solitude and Hopscotch finding avid English-reading audiences.",
    "In American fiction, postmodernism\u2014a term that would soon, to Acker's chagrin, be reflexively associated with her own work\u2014was in ascendance.",
    "Since the mid-sixties, experimental writing by the likes of John Barth, William Gaddis, and Thomas Pynchon had turned mainstream literature on its head while still, often, finding mainstream acceptance: in 1974, to cite just one major example, Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow shared the National Book Award with Isaac Bashevis Singer's A Crown of Feathers.",
    "Acker read all of these postmodernists, and loved some of them.",
    "But all of their writing showed her that you could write formally challenging, even difficult, fiction and it would find an eager audience.",
    "Maybe even more than that.",
    "Stein and Burroughs and Pynchon had all become, in their various ways, celebrities.",
    "Who knew how far she could go?",
    "I.",
    "It's not quite clear how much of her work her family actually read or even saw.",
    "Wendy remembered Acker giving Claire \"her first book,\" which may have been Politics but was more likely The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula.",
    "\"I don't think my mother got into it, didn't want to get into it,\" Wendy added.",
    "\"'You want to write about your family?'",
    "For my mother, that was the end of it.\"",
    "II.",
    "Unless Acker meant that she was twenty years old when she first began keeping the notebooks that comprised Politics, she was fudging or misremembering.",
    "She was actually twenty-five when the book was first published.",
    "FROM HER EARLIEST DAYS AS a writer, Acker's ambitions were almost entirely shaped by avant-garde, innovative, and experimental models.",
    "She had no interest in writing lyric or confessional poetry or middlebrow fiction.",
    "While she read widely, keeping a close eye on her contemporaries, she had little desire\u2014or arguably, the ability\u2014to produce work that was agreeable, expected, or docile.",
    "This was motivated by a familiar \u00e9pater la bourgeoisie and an elemental contrariness: \"I have a natural imp tendency to want to destroy.\"",
    "But it was also driven by idealism, a desire to make work that was nothing less than visionary, that could itself remake the world.",
    "\"Writers should present the human heart naked,\" she wrote, paraphrasing Edgar Allan Poe, \"so that our world, for a second, explodes in flames.\"",
    "She wrote to figure out why she acted in certain ways, why she thought in certain ways, how her memory worked, how experience was perceived and processed and represented, particularly the experience of reading, which remained perhaps the experience that most defined this most bookish of writers.",
    "She wrote to complicate herself.",
    "Unsurprisingly then, for the first many years of her writing life, she likewise spurned the traditional routes of publication, rarely submitting poetry or short fiction to major literary journals, or her novel manuscripts to agents and publishers.",
    "She instead formed her own spaces and channels, establishing her reputation first in the non-literary worlds of art, music, and performance.",
    "Her earliest books were self-published, and her work appeared only in alternative and small publications like David Meltzer's Tree, Lucy Sante's Stranded, and Mel Freilicher's Crawl Out Your Window.",
    "She would eventually coax the mainstream book industry toward her, though she would never shed her resistance to prevailing literary codes.",
    "Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer said that he never thought of her as a \"natural\" or \"easy\" writer, adding that she became one by \"hook or by crook.\"",
    "\"She's a different kind of writer,\" he said.",
    "\"She became a writer in spite of writing.\"",
    "Early on, Acker also renounced what many consider the very foundation of writing\u2014voice.",
    "For the vast majority of writers, developing or cultivating a literary voice is a natural part of becoming a writer; it's not an easy, logical, or always conscious process, but it is generally regarded as an essential and inevitable one, as routine as the creation of an individual personality.",
    "Your distinctive perspective, your worldview, your vocabulary\u2014all contribute to a writer's voice.",
    "And a significant part of this process is absorbing and then discarding the influence\u2014the voices\u2014of other writers.",
    "Almost as soon as she started seriously writing, Acker was suspicious of this very idea.",
    "It felt presumptive and oppressive, and she had zero faith in it.",
    "To begin with, why one voice?",
    "She didn't have a single voice.",
    "She constantly felt scattered, atomized, even schizophrenic, and shouldn't her writing reflect that?",
    "Like everyone, she had variable and multiple voices, registers, personalities, selves.",
    "\"A biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves,\" Virginia Woolf famously wrote in Orlando, \"whereas a person may well have as many as a thousand.\"",
    "Just as significantly, Acker found the idea paternalistic and patriarchal.",
    "To her mind, it privileged certain political perspectives and worldviews\u2014male, Western, white, heterosexual ones\u2014and naturalized them, made them universal and authoritative.",
    "There were, to use theorist Judith Butler's phrase, \"regulatory fictions\" that kept in place the idea of a subject that was unitary, transcendental, and rational.",
    "\"I was brought up in this poetry world where the idea was to express yourself,\" Acker said, \"and the last thing in the world I wanted to do was express myself.\"",
    "Acker preferred, she said, to \"pick everyone else's viewpoint, mush it all together.\"",
    "She didn't limit her attack to poets either, mocking the totalizing ambitions of establishment writers like Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, and John Updike.",
    "\"All those novelists have this thing about the great American novel.",
    "You have to write the Great American Novel.",
    "This perfect novel.\"",
    "She much preferred someone like the protean and prolific Jean-Luc Godard, whose ethos she described as \"just churn it out and if it's bad one time it's good the next.\"",
    "While the work of Mailer, et al., purported to represent some kind of universal experience, she considered it in fact \"superfluous.\"",
    "As a woman, as a poor person, as someone in pain, she didn't see herself in it at all.",
    "In the spring and summer of 1972, Acker was \"churning out\" writing that swerved between verse and prose.",
    "She collected several of these pieces in a kind of novella she titled The Burning Bombing of America: The Destruction of the U.S.I Like Politics, it uses reworked diary material and includes familiar figures\u2014Neufeld and Mayer, Jerome Rothenberg and Harris Schiff all make appearances.",
    "But the book is composed of several sections or chapters, with titles both austere\u2014\"Communist Aesthetics,\" \"Communist Story II,\" \"Abstract Essay Collaged with Dreams\"\u2014and absurd\u2014\"Outer Space Messages Total Chaos!",
    "\"\u2014and with a corresponding tone that shifts abruptly and frequently, from apocalyptic science fiction to revolutionary tract to alienated American yelp.",
    "At the end of the Bombing Burning typescript, Acker left a note to herself, presumably directions on how she should read the book aloud: \"read softly, evenly, like a story.",
    "2 minutes per page.\"",
    "But Burning Bombing barely resembles a conventional story, or even a coherent one.",
    "If it does tell a story, it's that, perhaps, of the curdling of the counterculture.",
    "\"\u2026 Bob Dylan shits out money,\" she writes, \"notice where the money lies you'll find out where the killers lie the men who are annihilating the universe\u2026\" When Acker looked around New York, around America, all she saw was corruption, chaos, and alienation\u2014a society fractured, a country in turmoil, the debris of utopia.",
    "The previous couple of years had been marred by Altamont, the Manson murders, Kent State, the splintering of SDS, and the rise of the Weathermen.",
    "Acker, like others, remained appalled by the sexism and racism that had undermined the revolutionary movement.",
    "Though there's no such explanatory note attached to Burning Bombing, a note that prefaces a group of poems Acker titled simply \"Works Done 1968\" helps frame her use of \"communist\" in the novella: \"By the word 'Communist' in these poems, I do not mean the Communist Party.",
    "To some extent I had them or some party in mind when I wrote many of the poems; I have found some of their members to be fascist pigs.",
    "By 'communist' I remind of 'communal' an imaginary communist group or world which I have not found yet to exist, the nearest being certain relations between women.\"",
    "Indeed, while Burning Bombing is often bleak and horrifying, it's enlivened by moments of exhilaration.",
    "Things fall apart, but can be rebuilt in new and better ways.",
    "Other worlds are always possible.",
    "Burning Bombing of America was never published in Acker's lifetime\u2014it doesn't seem like she tried to publish it or even wanted to\u2014but Grove Press released it in 2002, with a note by editor Amy Scholder suggesting it was written \"after Pierre Guyotat's \u00c9den \u00c9den \u00c9den.\"",
    "Guyotat was one of France's most daring and controversial novelists, a darling of renowned thinkers like Michel Foucault, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Jacques Derrida.",
    "His first novel, 1967's Tomb for 500,000 Soldiers, was a hallucinatory, psychosexual account of his time as a young soldier in the Algerian War.",
    "He was an extremely important writer for Acker, and would remain so for her entire life.",
    "\u00c9den \u00c9den \u00c9den was published in France in July 1970, though also prohibited from being sold to anyone under eighteen, and not translated into English for several years.",
    "In fact, Acker would translate it herself about nine years later.",
    "Set in Algeria, it's written in a lexicon and style\u2014visceral, incantatory, taxing\u2014quite distinct from conventional French prose.",
    "It consists of a single, unending, 256-page sentence, punctuated by colons, slashes, dashes, and swarming with repetitive, corporeal images.",
    "Bodies sweat, ingest, shit, gleam, bleed, quiver, fight, fuck.",
    "In its fusion of the avant-garde and the classical\u2014the book is really a kind of epic\u2014it was tailor-made for Acker.",
    "For her, Guyotat was trying to \"get beyond human psychology\" in his novels, to arrive at a material reality uninhibited by neurosis and idealism.",
    "Burning Bombing was perhaps written less \"after\" \u00c9den \u00c9den \u00c9den and more in dialogue with it.",
    "Acker's America was broken and malevolent, but it was not the war-torn Algerian desert.",
    "The writing borrows the aggression, acceleration, and, to a small degree, Guyotat's typographic innovations, but it is still gentler, more overtly domestic and personal.",
    "The book's opening lines and pages\u2014\"armies defect first in the woods and polluted lakes the cities small towns are covered in the blood of God in the burrows and hidden alleyways of unknown anarchists criminals buggering and fucking for ages\u2026\"\u2014most strongly echo Guyotat, but, as in her later books, that appropriation is soon abandoned or juxtaposed with other styles, other appropriations, other texts.",
    "Acker dedicated a couple of sections of Burning Bombing to Neufeld, but their three-year-old relationship was more or less over by the time she had finished the book.",
    "In the fall of 1972, she typed up a poem, \"Breaking Up,\" culled from longer entries in a notebook titled Household Objects, that seemed entirely composed of conversations between the two of them.",
    "Though none of the poem's lines is explicitly ascribed to either person, sentiment like this, which comes near its end, can clearly be attributed to Neufeld: \"you don't accept responsibility/you use men/you fear men\" and \"I've done everything/you're entirely irresponsible/you're unable to care for anyone but yourself.\"",
    "The end of the relationship was hastened, however, by a new romance that Acker began about a month before she wrote \"Breaking Up.\"",
    "In August, unemployed and at creative loose ends, she flew out to San Diego to visit Mel Freilicher and the Antins, hoping, it seemed, for some guidance and comfort.",
    "It wasn't a long trip and Acker left her stuff back in Washington Heights.",
    "When she found out that Jeff Weinstein had agreed to deliver a car cross-country to New York, she asked if she could tag along.",
    "Weinstein said sure, but that they would have another passenger with them, a buddy of his named Peter Gordon.",
    "Gordon was a twenty-one-year-old UCSD music student and aspiring composer, four years Acker's junior.",
    "He was gentle, generous, and cherubic, with full lips that matched Acker's own.",
    "If the small, wide-eyed Acker appeared childlike far into adulthood, Gordon looked, some said, like a giant baby.",
    "He was born in New York, spent his childhood in Virginia, and then his teen years in Munich, where his father worked as a journalist for Voice of America.",
    "In Germany, Gordon learned to play clarinet and saxophone and received an eclectic musical education: he watched the Munich opera perform Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg, and in clubs caught the likes of Duke Ellington, James Brown, and Ray Charles, even performing once himself with Chuck Berry.",
    "After Germany, the family moved to Los Angeles, where Gordon, then a senior in high school, ended up befriending a neighbor, Don Van Vliet, aka Captain Beefheart, and hung around as Beefheart recorded Trout Mask Replica, the landmark double album that launched a thousand avant-rock acts.",
    "While at UCSD, Gordon had a band, one of many he would form over the next few years, that transformed pop hits into free-form improvisations, and similar to Acker's feelings about contemporary poetry, he considered the art music of the time \"elitist\" and sought to make music that was \"hedonistic but also brainy.\"",
    "He and Acker hit it off.",
    "Too well, at times, for Weinstein\u2014they were soon having sex in the back seat of the car while he, somewhat exasperated, chauffeured them across the country.",
    "Weinstein was a bit surprised that they became so close so fast\u2014they seemed like very different people to him\u2014but Gordon was undeniably smitten.",
    "\"She was fascinating,\" Gordon recalled.",
    "\"She had this incredible energy: a certain self-centeredness, yet sort of an inherent na\u00efvet\u00e9, which was charming.\"",
    "He found her funny too, and affectionate, warm, and vulnerable.",
    "By the time they got to the East Coast, he had more or less fallen for her.",
    "Though Neufeld was still living in their apartment, Gordon ended up crashing there with Acker too.",
    "Neufeld didn't begrudge him anything\u2014he blamed Acker entirely for their breakup\u2014and he and Gordon eventually became reasonably good friends.",
    "After a week, Gordon returned to California.",
    "Three weeks later, and much to his surprise, Acker showed up at his apartment with her books and cats.",
    "They hadn't really discussed moving in together, and Gordon had never before lived with a girlfriend, but he nonetheless received her with open arms.",
    "(Not the cats, though\u2014he was allergic, and they were soon re-homed.)",
    "Gordon lived in an apartment in Solana Beach, the first neighborhood where Acker had lived with Bob Acker, and she was grateful to be living by the ocean once again.",
    "She reconnected with her old San Diego friends, joining a women's meditation group that Pauline Oliveros ran, planning a new literary and art magazine with Mel Freilicher.",
    "She seemed grateful for everything, in fact, especially for the chance to start over again.",
    "In a letter to Harris Schiff, who had decamped to New Mexico himself, she wrote, \"Split w/ Lenny & couldn't stand NY raped every night lungs couldn't function\u2026 anyway also there was this musician in S.D.",
    "I love\u2014so I split to S.D.!",
    "and!",
    "here!",
    "am I!\u2026\" To Bernadette Mayer, she described San Diego as \"paradise.\"",
    "She and Gordon would occasionally drive to L.A. to visit Gordon's family or to catch a concert, staying overnight.",
    "While at first Gordon's parents \"didn't know what hit them,\" Acker fit in surprisingly well.",
    "His father wrote plays and he and Acker bonded over literature.",
    "She even showed him her writing, which he gave her feedback on (but which he kept hidden from Gordon's mother, a psychotherapist).",
    "Acker often joined her and Gordon's grandmother in the kitchen and helped them cook.",
    "Before she moved out west, Acker had repeated in a letter to Gordon the \"DOWN WITH THE FAMILY\" couplet that she'd included in Politics, but the Gordons, it seemed, were the Jewish family that she wished she had\u2014or at least a family she felt comfortable and connected with.",
    "She soon started to refer to Peter as her brother; it was, she told Schiff, \"a sacred relationship.\"",
    "But as usual, she was broke (and now, after airfares, $500 in debt).",
    "Gordon had a grad school fellowship and his parents were also still helping to support him.",
    "He happily shared that money with Acker, but it wasn't a lot.",
    "To make ends meet, by that fall, she had started stripping in sailor bars around San Diego.",
    "It was a return to the sex industry, but a far cry from Times Square.",
    "\"It was performing,\" Gordon said, \"not like turning tricks.",
    "It was a show.\"",
    "She adopted a pseudonym, Target, and worked a circuit of different joints, sometimes performing for sailors just about to head off to Vietnam.",
    "Dancers supplied their own music, and Acker danced to the Velvet Underground or jazz musicians like Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane.",
    "While other dancers employed popular dance moves, Acker would call upon her classes with Meredith Monk and, Gordon said, \"dance interpretively, bringing out the angst, as well as the erotic joy.\"",
    "Full nudity was illegal in the city, so Acker wore a wig and various costumes; Gordon's grandmother, a lover of vaudeville, helped sew sequins onto her outfits.",
    "\"It's a nice place to work as a stripper,\" Acker later told an interviewer.",
    "\"You didn't get much money but sailors turn out to be very nice people.\"",
    "Through that winter, Acker read Henry James, Wilkie Collins, and Malcolm Lowry, and while she continued to write poetry, by the spring of 1973, she had also begun a novel.",
    "Titled Rip-off Red, Girl Detective,II it was a far different project than either Politics or Burning Bombing.",
    "It had the veneer of conventional, representational fiction\u2014a semblance of plot, loosely drawn characters, suspense\u2014and Acker even gave its typescript a kind of pulp fiction cover: a partial line drawing of a reclining woman, captioned with the expression \"\u200a'Nuff said!?",
    "!,\" Stan Lee's familiar Marvel Comics sign-off.",
    "It included a dedication too: \"For my brother Peter Peter.\"",
    "Acker didn't use her real name as author, however, preferring to use Rip-off Red as both pen name and titular character.",
    "Peter Peter is also the name of a character in the book, secretary and partner to Red, who describes herself as a \"superdetective.\"",
    "At the novel's opening, Red is planning to go from California to New York and \"rip off the money\" from the city's anarchists and junkies.",
    "On the plane there, Red meets a woman named Sally Spitz, who's trying to figure out why her father, a jeweler, keeps vanishing every night for several hours.",
    "Red takes the case.",
    "Before long, however, Spitz is murdered while at her parents' place, an apartment building at 57th Street and First Avenue, Acker's childhood address.",
    "Red vows to avenge her death.",
    "While Spitz may have grown up in Red/Acker's apartment, and has Acker's own daddy issues, it's Red herself who explicitly shares parts of Acker's biography.",
    "In the novel's second part, a flashback takes Red to her early childhood and teenaged years where, as the daughter of \"Oiving\" and \"Clear,\" she shuttles between wealth and poverty, travels through various New York boroughs, and forms a preposterously named criminal gang, the Banana Followers, with Harvey the Bagel and Weirdo the Rat.",
    "They rumble with a rival gang called the Tomatoes.",
    "Young Red learns to masturbate, to have sex, to hate her parents, to dream, to flee, to change her name.",
    "After this interlude, Acker returns to the plot, which speeds, with knowing absurdity, toward a conclusion that anyone familiar with Acker's work will find unsurprising: Spitz was murdered by her father.",
    "Acker described the novel as \"basically about illusion vs. illusion very abstract.\"",
    "Many of its pages are spent describing the sex that Red has with Peter Peter and various other men and women.",
    "The passages are detailed and breathless, raunchy, and repetitive.",
    "Acker wrote these pages for her own titillation, but also to make the book commercially appealing.",
    "She knew that other serious writers\u2014the Scottish novelist Alexander Trocchi, the poet Diane di Prima\u2014had written porn novels for money, and she thought Rip-off Red, if sold and marketed as such, could bring in a few hundred dollars.",
    "(Grove Press, she told Gordon, would be the \"perfect publisher.\")",
    "In a letter to Bernadette Mayer, she called it a \"pornography mystery\" and likened it to the cult anti-Western film Billy Jack: \"You're so entertained so much sex you don't know you're being blurped on the head until you fall down WHOOM.\"",
    "Acker spent eight hours a day working on it, off and on for six months.",
    "It never did make her any money, and like Burning Bombing, would languish, unpublished, among her papers for several years after her death.",
    "But it was her first long investigation into actual narrative, her first experimentation with genre conventions, the first inklings of the staccato, hard-boiled style she'd employ in her future writings.",
    "The book's final lines\u2014\"I'm no longer a detective.",
    "I'll decide to become someone else.",
    "\"\u2014would also herald the next significant chapter in her evolution as a writer.",
    "As a pseudonym, Acker would hold on to Rip-off Red a bit longer, but she would soon also adopt a more enduring and life-changing alias\u2014The Black Tarantula.",
    "I.",
    "The typescript of Burning Bombing reverses the order of the title and there is no colon between the two separate titles\u2014i.e., The Destruction of the U.S.",
    "The Burning Bombing of America\u2014but I have preserved the order as it appears in the Grove Press edition from 2002.",
    "II.",
    "Again, there's a slight discrepancy in the title.",
    "According to the typescript in Acker's Duke archive, the title eschews the hyphen and a colon is used instead of the comma: Ripoff Red: Girl Detective.",
    "I have again, however, deferred to the style of the 2002 Grove Press edition, Rip-off Red, Girl Detective.",
    "GORDON'S SOLANA BEACH APARTMENT WAS just around the corner from the Antins' house, and when Acker returned to California in late 1972, a more purposeful and experienced writer than when she left, that friendship became even more important.",
    "The two couples frequently met for breakfast, and she and Gordon occasionally babysat the Antins' son, Blaise.",
    "The Antins had been experimenting with new forms themselves and had arrived at methods and ideas that would, in ways subtle and significant, influence Acker's next artistic steps.",
    "David had already introduced Acker to the use of found materials, collage, and appropriation.",
    "But he added to that a different notion of how a poem might be written and performed, reversing the order of that process in fact, or turning it inside out.",
    "In April 1972, David was invited to give a reading at the art department of Pomona College, a couple hours north of San Diego.",
    "Rather than reading from notes or a published book, however, he simply cleared his throat and began to speak, improvising a lecture on art and art-making that was by turns witty, profound, and bracing.",
    "On the drive home, he and Elly listened to a recording of the talk, and Elly said, with characteristic certitude, \"That's a poem.\"",
    "David typed it up, and that talk, \"talking at pomona,\" became the first of what he would call \"talk\" poems.",
    "Artforum published it later that fall, and he also included it in his Kulchur Press book Talking.",
    "The talk poems became David's renowned, beloved signature, his own microgenre.",
    "It was speaking as thinking, talking as writing.",
    "The poems illustrated the power of improvisation, how capacious poetry really could be, and the pleasurable friction produced when combining the high- and lowbrow\u2014he moved deftly and sometimes comically between Wittgensteinian language games and quasi\u2013Borscht Belt routines about his mother.",
    "But David was quick to say that he wasn't an entertainer, and unlike, say, later examples like Spalding Gray or Garrison Keillor, he didn't \"give a damn if half the audience walks out.\"",
    "He was a master of metaphor, a master of the emblematic story, and his talk poems swarmed with both.",
    "A bit earlier, but continuing into 1973, Elly had started her own equally winning conceptual art project, 100 Boots.",
    "She placed a hundred black rubber boots on the beach below their house, facing the sea, and took a photograph of them.",
    "At David's suggestion, she made more pictures, all while moving the footwear from location to location\u2014outside a church, in a field, at an amusement park, at a Greek nightclub\u2014with, over time, the boots traveling from California to New York, where they made their way to MoMA.",
    "Over two-and-a-half years, Elly made fifty-one such pictures, which she turned into postcards and mailed to a list of a thousand people and institutions around the world.",
    "The boot's adventures became more fantastic\u2014they committed a crime, had a love affair.",
    "She first thought of the series as a picaresque novel in the vein of Huckleberry Finn or On the Road, and then more as a set of stills from a movie serial like The Perils of Pauline.",
    "The project, Elly said, was conceived to \"circumvent some of the spatial and temporal limits imposed on an artist whose work is shown in a gallery setting.\"",
    "It became a key piece in the relatively new medium of mail art, made most famous by Ray Johnson and various members of Fluxus.",
    "But Elly was busy with much more than her boots.",
    "Continuing her earlier investigations into identity, gender, and race, from the early seventies on, she created and adopted several fictional \"alternative selves,\" the performances of which she documented in several photographs and videos over the next couple of decades.",
    "She donned a fake mustache and beard, wig, floppy bucket hat, cape, and boots and became the King, a valiant, if impotent, monarch raging against the wealthy landowners of Solana Beach.",
    "For several weeks, she also assumed the identity of a fictional Black ballerina from Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, a blackface performance which Elly said she intended as a show of solidarity but which was later criticized as exploitative, ill-advised appropriation.",
    "Less problematic were two fictional white nurse characters, Nurse Eleanor and Eleanor Nightingale, both of whom appeared in videos she made in the late seventies.",
    "\"I consider the usual aids to self-definition\u2014sex, age, talent, time and space\u2014as tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice,\" Elly famously declared.",
    "These performances were part of a small, pioneering, contemporaneous wave of such work from women artists.",
    "In New York in 1973, Black conceptual artist Adrian Piper applied her own fake mustache, along with sunglasses and an Afro wig, for a project called The Mythic Being, in which she took diary entries she'd written as a teenager and presented them (in both Village Voice advertisements and live on city streets) as a physically different person.",
    "Suzy Lake's series of large-scale photographic self-portraits\u2014Transformations, from 1973 and '74\u2014depicted her \"becoming\" other women, men, and children.",
    "In San Francisco, the artist and filmmaker Lynn Hershman Leeson created a fictitious alter-ego named Roberta Breitmore, whom Leeson \"played\" in a series of actual real-life activities-cum-performances\u2014getting a driver's license, renting an apartment, undergoing psychoanalysis.",
    "There was a certain hybridity to all this work, with each artist borrowing and blending tropes and techniques from film, photography, and literature, all to make a new kind of conceptual art obsessed with role-playing, biography, perception, and gender.",
    "With Rip-off Red, Acker had attempted something similar, fusing noir, philosophy, and porn.",
    "The more time she spent with conceptual artists\u2014and also musicians, thanks to Peter Gordon\u2014the more that both visual art strategies and methods of musical composition illuminated new directions for her fiction.",
    "Though she would later reconsider and dismiss this idea, she learned from the conceptualists that what mattered most in making art was knowing why you did what you did.",
    "For a writer, she now felt, it was not enough to blindly, automatically use the language and methods given to you, which is what she believed most English-language novelists unthinkingly did.",
    "The conceptualists were also cannier about the circulation of their art, or at least had developed multiple ways to get it in front of people, to make a lasting impression.",
    "Elly's mailing list was one way, but there were also, of course, art galleries of various size and description, public spaces, magazines, even TV.",
    "Elly had a theory about the art world too, and it was something that Acker took to heart\u2014to get them to pay attention to you, you have to do the same thing over and over.",
    "\"It was not cynical,\" Mel Freilicher recalled.",
    "\"It was like, this is what you have to do.",
    "You have to make certain moves.",
    "It's not a question of pandering or doing what will sell.",
    "It's being emphatic.\"",
    "In June 1973, Acker started a new notebook, a UCSD-branded spiral-bound one, working out in its first few pages De Morgan's Laws, the rules of logic named for the nineteenth-century British mathematician Augustus De Morgan.",
    "Several of her notebooks from the period, in fact, (as well as brief passages in her earliest published books) are dappled with her musings on epistemology, perception, logical forms, memory, and language, influenced by her reading of philosophers like Henri Bergson, Gustav Bergmann, and Wittgenstein.",
    "At one point, she \"interviewed\" David Antin, with her purported questions and Antin's answers a collage of her, or their, own words and sentences cribbed from Wittgenstein's On Certainty.",
    "\"Do you care whether you can know I want to fuck you?\"",
    "Acker asks, tongue somewhere near her cheek.",
    "After dozens of pages of exercises and truth tables, however, the real work of the notebook begins.",
    "At the top of a page, Acker writes, \"Intention: I become a murderess by repeating in words the lives of other murderesses.\"",
    "Below that, in caps: \"THE CHILDLIKE LIFE OF THE BLACK TARANTULA.\"",
    "Acker repeats this on the front of the notebook, writing above it with typical self-deprecation, \"A Minor Work.\"",
    "This \"minor work,\" would, in fact, be a major breakthrough.",
    "Taking the autobiographical second part of Rip-off Red, Acker expands it, combining it with vignettes describing her daily life (set off in parentheses) and, most significantly, plagiarized, reworked extracts from historical crime books like Edward Hale Bierstadt's Enter Murderers: Eight Studies in Murder and Blood in the Parlor by Dorothy Dunbar.",
    "She continued this work into a second notebook, this one with the title THE BLACK TARANTULA DRIVES HERSELF INSANE: A DOCUMENT.",
    "Here, she writes \"by The Black Tarantula\" and, at the top of the notebook's cover, \"THE BLACK TARANTULA HAS ALMOST ELIMINATED HER IDENTITY.",
    "SHE BEGINS TO ELIMINATE HER FEAR.\"",
    "Between the two notebooks, she composed about thirty pages in this style.",
    "The piece's final sentence reads, \"I'm hysterical start screaming louder and louder,\" but in an accompanying note, Acker wrote with apparent satisfaction, \"calm end 'poetic.'",
    "\" In letters and on manuscripts, Acker would soon regularly be calling herself The Black Tarantula, TBT for short.",
    "But who was The Black Tarantula?",
    "Why The Black Tarantula?",
    "If Acker ever had a good reason for the pseudonym it's been forgotten or she never publicly divulged it.",
    "\"It's just another name,\" she told a friend at the time, \"and I like black, very sleazy.\"",
    "Years later, she told Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer that, back then, \"everybody wore make-up, everybody dressed up all the time and everybody changed their names.",
    "So I made up a name for myself.",
    "I liked tarantulas in those days, and I probably like them now.",
    "Mexican kids keep them as pets.\"",
    "She went on, seemingly also talking about how she saw herself: \"Everyone thinks they're horrible but they're really sensual, really soft and furry.",
    "They're not terribly dangerous.",
    "The worse thing they do is sting like a bee.\"",
    "But the name obviously had a number of alluring connotations.",
    "It conferred anonymity and secrecy, suggested danger and death.",
    "It could have been the name of a superhero, or a spy.",
    "It made her something other than a woman, other than human.",
    "It again, immediately, placed her identity in quotes and up for grabs.",
    "\"Being a poet and working with language is a lot like being a spider,\" David Antin wrote in \"The Structuralist\"\u2014a talk poem that offers some clues to Acker's work\u2014and \"working with silk because the language comes out of your mouth much the way thread comes out of a spider so that it looks like you've made it but only in a way\u2026\" Acker would later sometimes sign letters with just a hand-drawn, almost abstract, tarantula: a black dot with eight filament-like legs that curve outward like a sun's rays.",
    "As for the writing itself, what was this thirty-page whatsit supposed to be?",
    "Another prose poem?",
    "A story?",
    "The first chapter of a novel?",
    "Acker later said that she had the \"idea of doing like a Dickens novel, a serial where I'd send out chapters every month,\" though it's not clear when this idea occurred to her.",
    "There were other cultural examples of serials, of course\u2014pulp novels, on radio, in the movies\u2014and the tenor of Acker's piece hewed closer to the spirit of these.",
    "When she showed the work to the Antins, Elly suggested that Acker send the serials to everyone on the mailing list she made for 100 Boots.",
    "The two women had become closer\u2014\"I've never opened up to anyone before so much about my work,\" Acker said\u2014and she leapt at the idea.",
    "Acker soon began sending the chapters\u2014typed up, then mimeographed at a local newspaper office and stapled together\u2014often without identifying herself as their author, to artists and writers she did and didn't know: among them, the Rothenbergs, Sitney, Jackson Mac Low, Ed Ruscha, Barbara Barracks, Vito Acconci, Carolee Schneemann, Lawrence Weiner, Robert Duncan, John Perrault, Ron Silliman, Grove Press's Barney Rosset.",
    "\"That list in the pre-internet days was gold,\" the poet Eileen Myles wrote.",
    "\"You could actually reach out and touch the inside of all these people's mailboxes.\"",
    "Gordon helped her, stapling pages, stuffing envelopes.",
    "Acker tucked in the envelopes her own small, wry card, which read: \"You are on the enemy list of The Black Tarantula.\"",
    "Some recipients were puzzled, others intrigued, even thrilled, by the work.",
    "The format was modest, even primitive, but the writing was both anguished and aggressive.",
    "Her web grew quickly.",
    "\"She became the darling of the art world,\" Elly recalled.",
    "(Though not without a hint of retrospective rancor\u2014after Acker became well known, she regularly gave David Antin his due as a major influence, but almost never mentioned Elly.)",
    "\"It was about setting up friendships,\" Acker said of these early pamphlets.",
    "\"As if they were little letters to people that I sent out.\"",
    "The communication, in some cases, went two ways.",
    "In 1974, for example, Schneemann, a multidisciplinary artist best known for experimental performances and films like Meat Joy and Fuses, published Cezanne, She Was a Great Painter, an artist's book comprising letters and fragments from Acker's notebooks, manifestoes, and performance scripts.",
    "Included was a poem titled \"For The Black Tarantula,\" which argues, midway, in all-caps: \"OUR CIVILIZATION IS TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER/CIVILIZATION IS THOUGHTS OF OUR BODIES.\"",
    "\"I'm sick of not fucking knowing who I am,\" Acker writes in Politics.",
    "The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula was a way, she said, of figuring that out.",
    "But her method, as she outlined it anyway, was quixotic.",
    "Of all the things she knew and didn't know about herself, she knew, definitively, that she had never murdered anyone.",
    "So she raided the crime and law sections of the UCSD library and checked out all the biographies and autobiographies of famous female murderers she could find.",
    "She copied out sections from these books and then essentially inserted them into and alongside autobiographical sections that detailed her troubled family history, her money and health concerns, her current sex life and affairs.",
    "It was a real experiment, with these autobiographical sections serving, she said, as the \"control.\"",
    "In a letter to Jackson Mac Low, she described this technique in depth:             The Black Tarantula series (one's coming out a month) is basically my way of making myself schizophrenic, schizophrenic w/out the censor (identity, superego, causer of similar patterns) I half make up my own words, half use other people's jargon which slightly fits\u2026 the idea that if I'm do [sic] this slowly and don't scare myself by sudden shocks I'll be able to deal w/ other people more honestly & directly, evolve new ways of being with people, better ones, I'll break thru my overwhelming paranoia\u2014crack up the old identity god.",
    "So I copy texts (get rid of style, expressionism in writing) + become the people of the texts\u2026 In the second installment of The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula, Acker writes, \"I want to read books about schizophrenia, especially Laing's books and the books from Kingsley Hall.",
    "I'm getting sick of pornography and murders which is all I used to be interested in.\"",
    "And, indeed, Acker had immersed herself in such literature, reading books like Mary Barnes and Joseph Berke's Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness.",
    "She was particularly fascinated by R. D. Laing, the radical Scottish psychiatrist, and the ideas around schizophrenia that he explored in The Divided Self and Sanity, Madness and the Family.",
    "For Laing, madness was liberation and renewal, mental illness more theory than fact.",
    "\"Insanity is a perfect response to an insane world,\" Laing famously wrote.",
    "In a 1984 essay on Goya and Caravaggio, Acker reformulated this statement: \"The only reaction against an unbearable society is equally unbearable nonsense.\"",
    "Later in her life, as Acker's behavior became more erratic, narcissistic, and paranoid, Gordon and many other friends would suspect she suffered from undiagnosed borderline personality disorder, even possibly dissociative identity disorder.",
    "Certainly, qualities that she exhibited throughout her life\u2014a fear of abandonment, impulsiveness, disproportionate anger, frequent mood swings\u2014are symptoms of borderline personality disorder.",
    "But a posthumous diagnosis is impossible, of course, and risks pathologizing behavior, or thinking, that, as extreme as it could sometimes be in Acker's case, is hardly uncommon.",
    "More important is the fact that Acker zealously repudiated psychotherapy and analysis her entire life.",
    "She never had a conventional therapist, never sought, as far as we know, any course of psychiatric treatment; she had no interest in being \"cured\" or \"fixed.\"",
    "When she learned that Bernadette Mayer was seeing the celebrated analyst David Rubinfine, for example, she was horrified, arguing that Rubinfine was \"brainwashing\" her.",
    "\"I told Kathy it was none of her business,\" Mayer said.",
    "\"But she didn't approve of anything that so smacked of the bourgeoise.\"",
    "Perhaps.",
    "But Acker's attitudes may have stemmed from her many years of poverty, when she received inconsistent, even slipshod, treatment from various free clinics.",
    "She was also extremely suspicious of all authority, medical or otherwise.",
    "Gordon thought there was yet another reason, that Acker \"saw psychological pain as being her source of creativity.\"",
    "To interrogate this heartache then, with the aim of somehow reducing or altering it, could, theoretically anyway, destroy it.",
    "But there was more to it than that.",
    "The antipsychiatry of Laing\u2014and later, Deleuze and Guattari's incendiary, anti-capitalist critiques of Freud and Lacan\u2014was revolutionary for Acker.",
    "These philosophers offered a more productive, even joyful, way of slipping the confines of self and social order.",
    "They showed how fruitful paradox and contradiction can be.",
    "In The Childlike Life, the narrator constantly fractures or refracts, almost ecstatically describing an ever-shifting physical appearance and worldview.",
    "Now they are a woman, now they are a man, now they are a spider.",
    "Now they are Kathy, now they are Silver Gold Lam\u00e9 (another alias), now they are The Black Tarantula.",
    "Now they are a node, a network, a nothing.I \"I look at my body as if it were a web,\" Acker writes in one of the loveliest passages in her early work, \"solely a way of asking people to touch me.",
    "My body doesn't exist.",
    "I watch myself: I'm now heavy and even more beautiful: huge curves of thighs zooming into the valleys around my belly I begin to love myself as if I'm someone else no I realize my attractiveness coldly, I basically couldn't care how I look; I can see anything in a set of shifting frameworks.",
    "I'm interested solely in getting into someone else.",
    "I find the heavy flesh sensual, as if it were permanent.",
    "I'm not sure if I think of myself as a person.\"",
    "Maybe, contra Politics, it didn't matter so much if she didn't know who she was.",
    "Maybe it was more important that her identity didn't remain settled or fixed, that she was always becoming someone, or something, else.",
    "Acker worked tirelessly on The Childlike Life, tallying up the words on the inside back cover of her notebooks.",
    "She typically wrote three to four thousand words a day.",
    "Writing by day, stripping by night\u2014it was a considerably more relaxed version of the life she'd had in New York.",
    "Not without its difficulties, as she notes in this exemplary paragraph, but it was relatively stable: \"I live quietly I change my way of life I eat grains vegetables some dairy products because I have an ulcer I'm too poor to see a doctor about once a month I fall in love with someone at the same time I live with Peter who I love I rarely form friendships I deal awkwardly with people I fall in love with.\"",
    "She still also struggled from time to time with severe depression, and Gordon would do his best to help her.",
    "\"You knew there was a dark side,\" he said, \"but it took a while to see how deep it could really get.",
    "She would have these descending spirals of darkness that couldn't be stopped.\"",
    "This darkness manifested itself in harrowing ways: Acker would fixate completely on things, or utterly withdraw, becoming practically catatonic, and retreat to her \"cocoon-like\" bed.",
    "She still occasionally cut herself, and in letters over the next few years, there was the odd mention of suicidal thoughts.",
    "In Rip-off Red, Acker suggests that she even tried to hang herself once, though Gordon has no recollection of this.",
    "During these bouts of depression, he would cook and feed her miso soup, try to nurse her, but sometimes, he said, nothing consoled her, and they both just rode out the episodes.",
    "It's impossible to know how much this was bound up in Acker's relationship to her family.",
    "But, obviously, she repeatedly dredged up old offenses and indignities as she wrote, and this process inevitably affected her mood.",
    "As distant as they were from her physically, her extended family was never far from her psychically.",
    "Gordon recalled a road trip to Tijuana, where Acker bought an embroidered blouse with a high collar.",
    "\"I look just like my mother in this,\" she said.",
    "She wore it with pearls given to her by Nana.",
    "Around this time Acker also started to get semi-regular abortions.",
    "An early piece titled \"Murderers-Criminals Join Sunlight,\" which was part of a short sequence of poetic exercises and subtitled: \"Exercise #1: Create Music Through Repetitions of Own Sounds,\" lists the dates of two of her abortions before the poem begins: 10/28/72, 11/2/72.",
    "The dates line up with what she told Bernadette Mayer in a letter from the same time, that she had one unsuccessful abortion and then a second one four days later (\"which I hoped worked because I'm broke\").",
    "While some women find the abortion procedure deeply difficult, emotionally painful, and frightening, Acker tended to treat these operations with relative ease.",
    "She seemed to attach little psychological baggage to them, and she was publicly dismissive of their difficulty, treating abortion, more or less, as a form of birth control.",
    "\"She dealt with them very casually,\" Gordon recalled.",
    "Indeed, Acker seemed to almost revel in the act, as a defiance of certain societal norms, but also as a refusal, again, to have her body policed by anything or anybody.",
    "In the early nineties, in San Francisco, she went straight from an abortion to a photo shoot with her friend the philosopher Avital Ronell.",
    "Ronell was shocked, and when she expressed concern, a cavalier Acker waved it off\u2014\"Why are you being such a girl?\"",
    "In her writing, abortions would signify other things.",
    "In Blood and Guts in High School, she writes, \"Abortions are the symbol, the outer image, of sexual relations in this world.\"",
    "A graphic scene in an abortion clinic opens her Don Quixote, with the operation portrayed as an enlightening, even generative, process.",
    "In Memoriam to Identity, her feelings about the procedure are just as complex and political: \"When a woman's body turns into a baby-wanting machine and if the woman doesn't want a baby, she has to wage war against herself.\"",
    "And a few pages later, \"Since life and death are inextricably mixed, you can't condemn abortion.",
    "Maybe that's why I had so many abortions.\"",
    "Clearly, for all of her professed love of Gordon, she didn't want to have kids with him.",
    "Nor was she interested in a monogamous relationship with him.",
    "At the beginning of June, at the Antins', she met a writer and artist named Dan Graham, whom she quickly developed a crush on.",
    "Graham was five years older, and already an instrumental figure in the conceptual art world.",
    "She liked his work and his ideas about art, and he was friends with Bernadette Mayer too, another endorsement.",
    "He also had what she called \"a body I like: heavy enough to run into and feel its weight on me.\"",
    "But their romance, such as it was, was brief and unsatisfying.",
    "In The Childlike Life, Graham appears as D, a character who sleeps just once with the narrator and then promptly ghosts her:             I call up D in Los Angeles do you want to sleep with me with me when and where there why don't you spend a few days with me I'll call you tomorrow.",
    "No call three days later I'm maniacal I have to see D I don't know him hello I've got a ride to Los Angeles lie I'm not sure I know where we can stay should I not come up come up.",
    "We don't touch talk about anything personal spend night together I have to be at Irvine in the morning I'm busy call me Friday.",
    "Do you want me to call you yes.",
    "I call Friday call Saturday Sunday this is Kathy O uh do you want to spend a night with me again are you too busy I'm too busy uh goodbye have a good time in New York uh goodbye.",
    "In real life, the day after this dispiriting interlude, a tortured Acker wrote to Mayer asking for any information she might have about Graham.",
    "It's not clear what Mayer told her, if anything.",
    "But the D character floats through several chapters of The Childlike Life, a ghostly nonentity who is emblematic, finally, of an indifferent art world, cruel and unthinking men, and Acker's own vulnerability.",
    "Later, in a letter to Jackson Mac Low, she downgraded Graham to simply \"this artist creep\" who \"doesn't talk about anything but art.",
    "\"II Gordon more or less shrugged off these infatuations, which he saw as almost performative.",
    "\"It wasn't like I loved the idea but it was a funny thing,\" he said.",
    "\"It was almost like exploring different characters or something for her.\"",
    "He appreciated too that she was open and honest about the affairs, and never tried to deceive him.",
    "In any case, he enjoyed his own occasional dalliances and was also preoccupied with his own burgeoning career.",
    "By that summer, he had grown tired of the music program at UCSD and its emphasis on \"rigid, post-serialist modernism.\"",
    "He decided to transfer to Mills College in Oakland.",
    "John Cage had taught there, and, in his wake, it became an epicenter of experimental music: Terry Riley and Robert Ashley were on the faculty; Steve Reich, Trisha Brown, and Laurie Anderson were all, at one point or another, students.",
    "Acker agreed to join him.",
    "She didn't really want to leave San Diego, but she didn't think she could make money there any other way than stripping, and that lifestyle had become wearisome.",
    "Despite her ambivalence about the poetry community, she craved again the company of a wider circle of writers.",
    "And both of them wanted to live in a big city again but not necessarily New York.",
    "In July, she and Gordon drove up the coast and headed to Haight-Ashbury.",
    "I. Nineteen seventy-three was also the year that Flora Rheta Schreiber published Sybil, her explosive, controversial account of dissociative identity disorder (then known as multiple personality disorder).",
    "Acker never publicly mentioned the bestselling book, but it's interesting to note how she was exploring, in a much different way, related ideas around trauma, the formation of self, sexual abuse, and the malleability of memory.",
    "The writer Stephen Beachy touches briefly on this in his 2007 essay \"JT LeRoy and Narratives of Abuse,\" which compellingly situates the case of the fictional writer, JT LeRoy, against the backdrop of such books.",
    "Many figures in Acker's later circle, including Ira Silverberg, Dennis Cooper, and Eileen Myles, were duped by LeRoy's creator, Laura Albert.",
    "II.",
    "To the best of my knowledge, Graham has never spoken publicly about this fling with Acker.",
    "He never responded to my repeated interview requests.",
    "SAN FRANCISCO WAS A NEW city to Acker, but also a familiar and welcoming one.",
    "It had been a beacon for the Beats; home of San Francisco Renaissance poets like Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Duncan, and Jack Spicer; the cradle of both the New Age movement and the sex industry.",
    "An enormous gay and lesbian community flourished there\u2014the Daughters of Bilitis, whose dances Acker had attended in Manhattan, and their male counterpart, the Mattachine Society, had relocated there from Los Angeles in 1955.",
    "In 1969, there were fifty gay organizations in the city; by the time Acker and Gordon arrived, four years later, there were eight hundred.",
    "The Cockettes, an anarchic, gender-bending theater troupe that emerged out of a commune in the Haight, and which Acker often credited as an influence, had more or less disbanded by 1973, but their spirit lived on in the equally outrageous Angels of Light.",
    "\"Everyone goes around saying love all the time (really!!",
    "),\" she told Jackson Mac Low, \"it's like a cloud of nuttiness covers this city\u2026\" Acker and Gordon settled in the ground-floor apartment of a three-story Victorian at 46 Belvedere Street.",
    "The apartment had two separate parlors, with Acker using one as a writing room and Gordon using the other as a studio.",
    "Missing her cats, Acker replaced them with other animals: two hamsters, named Art and Revolution, and a pair of parakeets, Jackson Mac Low and John Cage.",
    "Around the corner were a few other friendly musicians, all of whom were loosely affiliated with Mills and all of whom had adopted their own winsome stage names: \"Blue\" Gene Tyranny, Clay Fear, Phil Harmonic, Rich Gold.",
    "They shared a house they dubbed the Honeymoon Hotel, and Gordon and Acker soon became close to them.",
    "It was an age of aliases.",
    "Aside from Lynn Hershman Leeson's Roberta Breitmore, San Francisco was also home to a Canadian mail artist named Anne Lee Long, who had refashioned herself as Anna Banana when she moved to the city and founded Vile magazine, a parody of General Idea's FILE, itself a parody of LIFE.",
    "Several months after Acker's arrival, a group of militant revolutionaries calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army, who had previously murdered Oakland school superintendent Marcus Foster, kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst from her Berkeley apartment.",
    "Two months later, Hearst claimed to have joined the group and changed her name to Tania.",
    "SLA leader Donald DeFreeze's nom de guerre was Field Marshal Cinque, and other members had aliases like Mizmoon and Yolanda.",
    "Acker's own appearance shifted frequently\u2014she'd grow her hair out a bit, then cut it very short again.",
    "Sometimes she wore lots of makeup, other times none.",
    "Gordon himself occasionally went around in drag, going by the name Art Povera.",
    "When Acker listed her name in the phone book, she used both The Black Tarantula and Rip-off Red.",
    "At first, life in San Francisco wasn't all that different from life in San Diego.",
    "\"Basically I eat, shit, fuck etc, read and write,\" she told Harris Schiff.",
    "To Mac Low, she was more effusive: \"Even tho I still haven't gotten over the jolt of entering another new environment, & that swirling in my head, I feel I can live here\u2026 artists are so open here.\"",
    "As always, though, money was extremely tight, especially as Gordon's father had by then stopped helping them out.",
    "Acker still refused to get a job\u2014\"I've made the final decision not to work unless the work concerns my writing, I'd rather starve\"\u2014and Gordon was compelled to support them both, taking various night and day jobs to do so while still attending classes at Mills.",
    "One of those night jobs was working at a porn bookstore, where Freilicher would cruise when he came up to visit.",
    "To save money, Gordon cut Acker's hair.",
    "She frequently skipped meals, preferring, she said, to use what little grocery money they had to pay for the printing and mailing of The Black Tarantula serials.",
    "Late that summer or early fall, for a payment of a hundred dollars, Acker agreed to do a new translation of Aristophanes's Lysistrata for a colleague of Rothenberg's named Charles Doria.",
    "She soon gave up, however, finding the play dull\u2014\"too much of it came off as women's lib cant which I guess I've heard too much of or something.\"",
    "She offered instead to translate another of Aristophanes's plays, Thesmophoriazusae, which she'd seen performed by the Angels of Light, and which tells of a group of Athenian women who plot to kill Euripides because of his misogyny.",
    "Acker also proposed including an introduction that would, in effect, be a meta-translation, accounting for both her research on Greek society of the period and her experience writing the translation: \"I have to translate autobiographically and that means including the ideas I read think express feel act on etc.",
    "that preceed [sic] my actual translation of words of play.\"",
    "At the end of an explanatory letter to Doria, she added a handwritten postscript: \"The obvious idea of Aristophanes: that politics should be determined by sexual and individual needs, not vice versa, is important to me.\"",
    "She included a copy of this introduction (\"a TARANTULA of ideas,\" she called it), which, in keeping with her writing from the period, juxtaposed frank, even miserable, descriptions of her daily life with snatches of, among others, Aristophanes, Plato, Yeats, and W. G. Forrest's The Emergence of Greek Democracy.",
    "What Doria thought of Acker's proposal is unknown, but it clearly wasn't what he, or his publisher, had bargained for.",
    "He would eventually publish an anthology of newly translated classic work in 1980 and Acker's Thesmophoriazusae would not be part of it.",
    "At the same time, she continued to produce new installments of The Childlike Life, turning out a new one every month or so.",
    "A third installment was titled \"i move to san francisco.",
    "i begin to copy my favorite pornography books and become the main person in each of them.\"",
    "Those pornography books included Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Isabelle, Violette Leduc's notorious tale of adolescent lesbian love, which Acker mashed up with half-remembered, half-fantasized scenes from Lenox.",
    "A fourth installment used The Carnal Days of Helen Seferis by Alexander Trocchi\u2014\"my favorite pornographer,\" she said of him, \"I've never seen a man so well understand female sexuality.\"",
    "In a fifth, she \"becomes\" Yeats.",
    "\"I'm trying to become other people because this is what I find interesting,\" she explains.",
    "\"I'm trying to get away from self-expression but not from personal life.",
    "I hate creativity.",
    "I'm simply exploring other ways of dealing with events than ways my lousy habits\u2014mainly installed by parents and institutions\u2014have forced me to act.",
    "At this point, I'm over-sensitive and have a hard time talking to anyone.",
    "I can fuck more easily.\"",
    "In the sixth and final installment, she immerses herself in the words and biography of the Marquis de Sade: \"sometimes I think he's horrible, sometimes I think he's great, but he always makes me question.\"",
    "On the last page of the typescript, Acker wrote \"This will be the last TARANTULA for a while,\" but by May 1974, she'd started making notes toward a follow-up she called I Dreamt I Was a Nymphomaniac!",
    ": Imagining.",
    "In a preview of the censorship Acker would run into later in her career, some printers refused to print the books because they found them morally offensive.",
    "More bothersome to her was the rejection of printer-publisher Noel Young, to whom Kenneth Rexroth had referred Acker.",
    "Young was the founder of Capra Press, a celebrated micro-publisher in Santa Barbara that published short, offbeat books by the likes of Henry Miller, Ray Bradbury, and Raymond Carver, and he felt Acker was simply not in their league (\"too green\").",
    "Even worse than this, however, was the criticism she received from old friends like Bernadette Mayer and Harris Schiff.",
    "While Mac Low had praised the pamphlets\u2014\"the use of abstraction and philosophical self-analysis is brilliant\"\u2014Mayer had characterized them as polemical, boring, and didactic.",
    "Whatever Schiff's actual comments were\u2014they're lost to time\u2014they clearly stung too.",
    "In December, Acker wrote him a forceful defense that summed up her perspective and intentions:             If you have something to say about the TARANTULAS say it, and I'll reply if I think a reply's necessary.",
    "I basically don't care about criticism because I'm more interested in ideas than in whether I've said something nicely or whatever, but I'm really interested in talking about the ideas which are the TARANTULAS.",
    "Re: \"how come I write mainly about myself?\"",
    "and \"why don't I make up new people?",
    "\": I don't write mainly about myself though I use the word \"I\" rather than the second or third person.",
    "I use basically found material, material written by other people; about one fourth of the TARANTULAS, if that much contains autobiographical material.",
    "I'm interested in my relations to other people, my possibility of getting outside of myself.",
    "Since I'm interested in this as a real problem, I don't make up people, because then I'd still be dealing with only my own thoughts, I try to use the thoughts etc.",
    "of real people.",
    "I'm not interested in self-expression (perhaps you misunderstood some of the ideas, or I haven't been expressing them clearly enough)\u2026 If Acker was discouraged, that feeling didn't last for long.",
    "In Nymphomaniac, she doubled down on her ideas.",
    "Continuing her excavation of self, she still used diary material and still gave characters the names of her friends and lovers\u2014the title itself was a nod to Elly Antin's I Dreamt I Was a Ballerina.",
    "Peter Gordon appears as an SLA agent and \"the most gorgeous fag in town,\" sometimes male, sometimes female.",
    "\"I assured her I would never stand in the way of her work,\" Acker writes of this quasi-fictional Gordon.",
    "\"I mainly needed to be financially supported, left alone, fucked, told I'm a wonderful writer.\"",
    "Acker continues to shift abruptly between dream narratives, plundered passages from other books, and her own eccentric reimaging of current political crises like the Attica prison riots.",
    "In Nymphomaniac, though, she abandons the reader-friendly signposts she'd used in The Childlike Life: the parenthetical demarcation, the lists of plagiarized books that punctuated each installment.",
    "For astute readers, however, the source material was hardly hidden.",
    "Most apparent, perhaps, was Blaise Cendrars's 1926 novel Moravagine.",
    "An underground classic, the book chronicles the exploits of its titular anarchist and murderer, who, released from a hospital for the criminally insane by a sympathetic and obsessed psychiatrist, embarks on a global reign of atrocity, terror, and revolution.",
    "Cendrars, a name that was itself yet another pseudonym, argued that Moravagine was his double.",
    "\"What an incredible fucking writer he is,\" Acker said of Cendrars.",
    "\"The speed at which he goes!\"",
    "Acker transposed sections of the novel from Russia to an unruly, politically fraught America, renamed Moravagine for Gordon's teacher Bob Ashley, and substituted figures, like the anarchist Peter Kropotkin, with Patty Hearst.",
    "Just as she's been for many other writers, artists, and filmmakers, Hearst was a seductive subject for both Acker and Gordon.",
    "As with the Weathermen, the SLA's radicalism held an undeniable (if temporary) romantic charge.",
    "Acker and Gordon were intrigued by what Hearst's outlandish story said about racial politics, capitalism, the possibilities and limitations of revolutionary activity, and, as always, the refusal to be, in Acker's words, \"an enclosed individual.\"",
    "There was a material appeal too for Gordon.",
    "The SLA communicated their demands through cassette tapes that the group sent to local radio stations.",
    "Gordon recorded these communiqu\u00e9s and, in the studio, edited and blended Hearst's voice with those of friends like Tyranny and Phil Harmonic, who repeated her words.",
    "He called the piece \"Greetings from the SLA.\"",
    "The true subject of Nymphomaniac, however, was Acker's philosophical investigations, the concentrated representation of which was almost unheard of in American fiction, mainstream or otherwise.",
    "\"Ideas are most important,\" she told Mayer, \"don't cover over ideas with fancy writing.\"",
    "Still concerned with investigating or exploding an authorial \"I,\" she now wanted to see how memory and imagination shaped subjectivity.",
    "In a notebook, she mapped out, more or less, what she was trying to do in the book:                                                               use myself changing as model for change.",
    "Change \u2192 changing memory  (can't get rid of memory)  but remembering concerns changing past in terms of present: present desire rel for future.",
    "Making this clear/find more about remembering in terms of changing myself  Remembering involves repeated time (Kubler)                           what if imagining  involves this time?",
    "what if repeated time  becomes revolutionary?",
    "Q: How does (my) remembering differ from my imaginings?",
    "Kubler was George Kubler, the art historian and author of The Shape of Time, a study of formal and symbolic ideas of duration.",
    "But Acker was also reading Sartre and the Austrian mathematician and philosopher Gustav Bergmann, whose knotty writings on ontology she found particularly useful.",
    "Nymphomaniac, unsurprisingly, was a more challenging project than The Childlike Life, \"a messier work on the whole,\" and more difficult to write.",
    "\"I was searching for something,\" Acker told an interviewer.",
    "But what?",
    "What did she hope these experiments would help her find?",
    "A way to process the painful memories of her childhood, or to determine which were true?",
    "(\"My first remembering is my desire not to perceive events as they are,\" she writes.)",
    "Or a way to, again, figure out who she was and what she really desired?",
    "(\"Intention: escape this horror as I know it and made by it.",
    "How can I (I being a model of any individual) change?",
    "Assume the relativist theory of time accurately maps time in the world.",
    "'I change.'",
    "What do I mean by 'I'?\")",
    "Or was this just a way to make fiction that felt sufficiently rigorous, even revolutionary?",
    "(\"My mission is to reveal the uncertainties, unimportances, and final equivalents of all identities.\")",
    "All of the above, most likely.",
    "\"Why shouldn't writing be everything?\"",
    "she wrote to Mayer.",
    "But if Nymphomaniac was a more difficult book to write, it's also a more difficult book to read.",
    "It's often bewildering and occasionally muddled; Acker's refusal to revise gives it an often inhospitable shape.",
    "When Acker's work is described as \"raw,\" critics and readers are usually referring to the emotion and sex in her books, but here too, the overt philosophy could be called raw, or, at the very least, lightly processed.",
    "Mayer was right to call it dull, at least in parts.",
    "While Acker could, and does, subtly weave philosophical ideas into her work, large sections of Nymphomaniac are also clotted with chunks of academic deliberation that wouldn't be out of place in the grad school seminars she had recently fled:             I write down a certain number of words repeat those words again.",
    "Does the first unit of words mean the same as the repeated unit?",
    "That is, either events in time (as for time, for space) are isolated, or mutually dependent with regard to meaning not existence.",
    "(For a moment, skip the problem of meaning and existence.)",
    "If the meaning(s) of the writing events depend(s) at least partially on the temporal relations of the writing events, the relativist theory of time seems more accurate.",
    "In the book's most notorious sequence, Acker relates a dream that encompasses her family, the art world, and sex.",
    "The dream ends or fades out: \"As we're fucking, her boyfriend enters the room and stops us because we're not supposed to act sooo\" Then, the dream sequence begins again, word for word, concluding with the same fade-out.",
    "Like a musical refrain, she repeats it again, two more times, and the chapter ends.",
    "Such repetition occurs frequently throughout the first half of the book.",
    "\"I wanted to see if repeating would change things,\" she said.",
    "\"If time was basically made up of moments.",
    "If it was qualitative or quantitative.\"",
    "Also, perhaps, the repetition of moments, particularly the harrowing ones of her childhood, offered a chance to start over.",
    "Perhaps she had in mind again Gertrude Stein, who wondered if repetition existed, or whether it should just be called insistence?",
    "Acker shuffles subjects, ideas, and perspectives with the kind of speed that she admired in Cendrars, but then often slows down, and even runs aground, on the reef of her ruminations.",
    "Nonetheless, the novel would find fans among Language poets like Barrett Watten, whose essay, titled \"Foucault Reads Acker,\" describes Nymphomaniac as a \"liberationist text [which] records an undoing of self at a historical moment of political crisis that Acker wishes to perpetuate by textual means,\" and the New Narrative writer Robert Gl\u00fcck, both of whom would become close to Acker.",
    "Gl\u00fcck first stumbled across the book at the Small Press Traffic bookstore in San Francisco before he had ever heard of or met the writer.",
    "At first, he recoiled from Acker's refusal of readerly pleasure or even stability, then enthusiastically embraced her strategies: \"Rather than drawing conclusions, developing identifications or thematic connections, that is making judgements that lead to knowledge, Acker creates a reader who is lost in strangeness.\"",
    "For McKenzie Wark, who credits Acker with helping her transition from male to female, Acker's almost nonchalant insistence on gender fluidity in Nymphomaniac and her other books was literally life-changing: \"A mythic world opens in which genders and sexual orientations emerge together, mutate together, differentiate together.\"",
    "Though Acker described herself at the time as a \"bloody hermit,\" she ventured frequently into San Francisco's literary and art scenes.",
    "Most Tuesdays, she swung by Intersection, a performance and poetry space then located in an old Methodist church in North Beach.",
    "When the Empty Elevator Shaft, a print-shop-cum-bookstore in Noe Valley, started its own short-lived reading series, Acker attended that too and had some of her Black Tarantula serials printed there.",
    "As she finished additional installments, she continued to diligently disseminate them through her mailing list, while also taking them to bookstores like Berkeley's Sand Dollar, where she sold them on consignment.",
    "(Acker stayed in touch for decades with the Sand Dollar's owner, Jack Shoemaker, later the founder of the venerable North Point Press, publisher of Guy Davenport and Juan Goytisolo, among many others.)",
    "At least once a week, she also accompanied Gordon to Mills, where she became friendly with faculty like Robert Ashley (\"wonderful nice to me,\" she told Jerome Rothenberg).",
    "Ashley, then forty-three, was a renowned composer and creator of conceptual theater, sometimes called the greatest genius of twentieth-century opera.",
    "His enthusiasm was legendary, his innovations myriad, his influence on American musicians like Laurie Anderson and David Byrne profound.",
    "His most famous work was arguably 1983's Perfect Lives, a cryptic, sui generis television production that ostensibly chronicles two musicians staging a prank bank robbery in a small Midwestern town and which has been called variously the first American opera, a performance novel, and a magpie nest of language.",
    "Though no fan of opera herself, Acker later credited Ashley with showing her how to create writing that was more of an \"environment\" rather than centralized, meaningful narrative\u2014a \"de-narrative,\" she called it.",
    "At one point, she and Ashley contemplated writing a movie together (\"a saga about the Midwestern U.S., of sorts, and the pathology of everyday living\"), a project which, alas, never came to fruition.",
    "In a letter to Bernadette Mayer, Acker wrote that her male \"art stars\" were Ashley, Gordon, Lawrence Weiner, and David Antin; the female ones were Mayer and Elly Antin.",
    "(Dan Graham was \"on outs.\")",
    "When Acker and Gordon first arrived in San Francisco, they started hosting a weekly three-hour show on KPOO, a local community radio station.",
    "The couple were told they could do whatever they wanted, and they did, with Acker reading work by Antin, Mac Low, de Sade, or her own writing.",
    "Gordon played music by the likes of Arthur Honegger, invited Ashley and Terry Riley on as guests.",
    "\"I don't know if anyone listens,\" Acker wrote to Mac Low, \"but it's fun.\"",
    "Soon, however, they learned the station's managers were not quite as permissive as they had first thought.",
    "At some point on-air, Acker told a story about how she lost her virginity, and on another occasion, Gordon had Ashley present a talking piece.",
    "The first violated FCC regulations; the latter KPOO deemed too boring.",
    "The show was dropped.",
    "\"It was very repressive and very demeaning,\" Gordon told the Berkeley Barb at the time.",
    "A few months later, though, they debuted another show on Berkeley's KPFA, the first listener-supported broadcaster in the country.",
    "High Art in Its Highest Glory was essentially proto-talk radio, a three-hour program during which Acker and Gordon (and later Ashley) would chat about various topics and ideas, then take calls from listeners, who could talk about whatever they wanted.",
    "Gordon mixed and layered the various voices, creating an alluring soundscape.",
    "Acker, Gordon recalled, \"had no filter.\"",
    "At one point, someone with whom she'd been having an affair called in, and they broke up on the air.",
    "Soon enough, they received an admonishing letter from the station's program director, and that show was canceled too.",
    "Gordon's cohort at Mills was tiny and tight-knit, and he quickly befriended a classmate named Jill Kroesen, who also went by the stage name Fay Shism.",
    "Kroesen was a lissome, dark-haired musical daredevil who, like Gordon, mingled rock and pop with avant-garde experimentation.",
    "Her MFA thesis at Mills was built around a song she composed, \"Fay Shism Blues,\" which reimagined Hitler as a femme fatale.",
    "Gordon performed on that, and the pair would collaborate frequently over the next few years, including on Ashley's Perfect Lives.",
    "Kroesen loved Gordon, calling him years later \"the greatest guy in the universe.\"",
    "Her feelings toward Acker were more complex.",
    "While acknowledging that Acker was smart and charismatic, she also thought that Acker \"didn't care about other people's feelings at all,\" and Kroesen never found her particularly friendly.",
    "This might have had something to do with the fact that Kroesen and Gordon ended up sleeping together.",
    "It was a fling, and only lasted a couple of weeks, but as Gordon had learned by that point, Acker's attitudes toward monogamy didn't exactly extend to her partners\u2014she could be extremely possessive.",
    "Kroesen also had a difficult time with Acker's writing.",
    "She had endured her own \"horrible\" childhood, had been sexually abused, in fact, and found any violent or pornographic art extremely upsetting.",
    "She was amazed that Acker would willingly revisit her own childhood memories in her books.",
    "\"In her work, it was like she was running like a mad person away from the pain,\" Kroesen said, \"but leaving this trail of information to figure it out.\"",
    "Still, Kroesen was captivated enough by Acker to write several songs about her over the next couple of years, ditties both affectionate and acerbic, like \"Don't Steal My Boyfriend,\" \"Please Don't Hurt Me,\" \"Lenny and Kathy,\" and \"Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Blues.\"",
    "\"Prince Charming Blues,\" which Kroesen dedicated to Acker, borrowed a refrain from the Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\" sandwiching it between verses like \"I had a boy with a penis as long as a kitchen knife/When he tried to fuck me I thought I'd lose my life/I left him for a gorgeous man whose prick was short and fat/But oh my god he comes too fast.\"",
    "Kroesen, who was also a talented graphic artist, ended up designing a cover for the first printed edition of The Childlike Life\u2014a collage with a stylized spider splayed over Acker's face.",
    "Acker never really cared for it, and ditched the image in all subsequent editions.",
    "As Gordon became intimate with Kroesen, Acker continued to seek out her own extracurricular romances.",
    "\"Lots of street sex, bang, bang, bang,\" she told Mac Low.",
    "For a while, she had a standing weekly liaison with Honeymoon Hotel resident Rich Gold, and there were other brief encounters, including a one-night stand with the poet-novelist Andrei Codrescu.",
    "In February 1974, she embarked on an affair of more lasting significance with the conceptual artist and writer Alan Sondheim.",
    "The relationship was fraught and, from the start, bound up in Acker's messy family history.",
    "That month she flew to New York to collect a small trust fund that her maternal grandfather had left her: $300 in cash, as well as an additional hundred dollars' worth of stock dividends.",
    "As Acker told it, this money had been kept secret from her, with her parents forging her signature and keeping the dividends for themselves.",
    "How exactly Acker learned about the trust is unclear, but what made its existence even more dramatic was the fact that the check was made out to someone named Karen Lehman.",
    "Here, at last, was her actual birth name.",
    "Her biological father, she had finally discovered, was someone named Harry Lehman, Jr. She learned that he was the scion of the family that founded the Buffalo-based Wildroot Company, a hugely successful purveyor of hair tonics, shampoos, and other products.",
    "(Ronald Reagan appeared in their advertisements; Colgate-Palmolive bought the company in 1959.)",
    "Acker was stunned and disoriented.",
    "At long last, at twenty-six years of age, she was close to tracking down her real father.",
    "Or was she?",
    "While she suddenly had the information she'd long sought, she didn't quite know what to do with it.",
    "What did she want from this father she had never known, and who supposedly hadn't wanted her?",
    "The discovery briefly paralyzed her.",
    "While she would travel to New York and briefly visit Claire and Bud, she wouldn't, it seems, actively try to find Lehman for over a year.",
    "Instead, as she'd been doing her whole writing life, she'd once again transmute his abandonment into art.",
    "On February 18, she read at the Poetry Project alongside Mel Freilicher and Ed Bowes.",
    "Alan Sondheim was in the audience.",
    "Sondheim was five years older than Acker, thin and nebbishy, with a nimbus of thick, dark hair.",
    "He was a prolific polymath who'd already produced a thicket of book-length essays, spoken-word performances, and experiments with new technology, and Acker, who'd heard about his work through David Antin, was curious about him.",
    "A couple days after the reading, she had dinner with him and his wife, Beth Cannon, at their apartment on 17th Street, where Acker said, they \"talked for twelve hours.\"",
    "Acker returned to San Francisco a couple days later, but their connection was intense, and they decided, over the course of several letters and phone calls, that they would make a videotape together \"exploring sexuality.\"",
    "Sondheim scrounged some money from the Rhode Island School of Design, where he was a guest artist, recruited a student named Emily Cheng to operate the camera, and flew Acker back to New York at the beginning of March.",
    "At his apartment, they ended up making two tapes, though the second one, a satire of the first\u2014an \"inverse, both sexually and in terms of mood,\" in Sondheim's words\u2014was lost for several decades.",
    "The first, however, became a small sensation.",
    "Over the course of fifty-four black-and-white minutes, Acker and Sondheim engage in a kind of dispassionate verbal jousting, trying to define both themselves and their relationship to each other.",
    "Or, more accurately perhaps, perform this act of definition.",
    "Acker's hair is buzzed short, and she's wearing rimless glasses, dangly earrings, a dark cotton scarf around her neck.",
    "They talk haughtily about control, about perception, about power.",
    "With Lehman fresh in her mind, Acker says she regards Sondheim as a father figure\u2014her \"perfect father\"\u2014or as a kind of analyst, using him to get to memories that were too painful for her to access any other way.",
    "Sondheim, for his part, thought Acker was his \"soulmate.\"",
    "He calls her a \"powerful person,\" and says, to Acker's evident delight, \"You're gonna kill people, baby, you really are.\"",
    "Much of their conversation, however, or their respective monologues, occurs as they are having actual sex.",
    "Cheng's camera captures, with intermittent focus, Sondheim stroking Acker's clit and her rimming him and sucking him off while he struggles to narrate his thoughts and sensations.",
    "Sondheim later remembered Acker acting \"suicidal\" during a break in the taping, though Cheng only remembers Acker's self-confidence and her \"utter lack of self-consciousness with her body and emotions.\"",
    "Chris Kraus situated the tape in the lineage of confrontational conceptual art that included Vito Acconci's Seedbed and Chris Burden's Shoot, but the overall effect is something like an early Chantal Akerman film rewritten by Woody Allen.",
    "\"We pushed things as far as we could,\" Sondheim later wrote.",
    "\"I felt needy.",
    "I hated myself.\"",
    "The tape was later shown at St. Mark's, Yale, RISD, and the Whitney, among other places, titillating, amusing, and repelling its various audiences.",
    "Eventually, Acker and Sondheim agreed not to show the tape without their mutual consent; they both considered the experiment a failure.",
    "Acker never talked publicly about the two tapes, and only rarely, as she became a better-known writer, did she ever mention Sondheim.",
    "It seemed she would have preferred the whole experience be forgotten.",
    "But over the years, the first tape, which was never formally titled, became known as The Blue Tape and, when it was rediscovered a few years after Acker's death, took on the aura of an archaeological treasure.",
    "It was a glum artifact of the New York art world in the early seventies, with its dubious gender dynamics, sexual gamesmanship, and intellectual braggadocio on full display.",
    "You can practically smell the bodies.",
    "The emotional vulnerability, performative or not, is oppressive.",
    "For Acker devotees, however, it was a rare, unedited glimpse of her charm and difficulty, and, above all, the lengths she would go in the name of self-determination and knowledge.",
    "THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SONDHEIM WAS intense and destabilizing, but it died down as quickly as it had flared up.",
    "By that summer, Acker had become disenchanted, calling him \"a shit\" and \"a schmuck.\"",
    "She'd also found a different focus for her romantic energies.",
    "At the Empty Elevator Shaft, where he was giving a reading with Barrett Watten, she met Ron Silliman, a poet whom David Antin had suggested she look up.",
    "Silliman was about a year older than her, and had been raised in Albany, California, just north of Berkeley.",
    "Then, and throughout his career, Silliman moved between quite different spheres\u2014after registering as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, he worked for the Committee for Prisoner Humanity and Justice while also writing and publishing several books, organizing readings himself, and serving as executive editor of the Socialist Review.",
    "Silliman became one of the best-known Language poets, a group of formally adventurous poets in the Bay Area and New York whose name was derived from the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E journal edited by Bruce Andrews and Charles Bernstein.",
    "The Language poets, as the Acker scholar Georgina Colby usefully defines them, rejected the \"processural\" poetics of Charles Olson, which had once influenced Acker, and \"attacked the instrumental value of language put forward and sustained by a capitalist society.\"",
    "Their number included Rae Armantrout, Clark Coolidge, Carla Harryman, Bob Perelman, Hannah Weiner, and Lyn Hejinian, among others.",
    "Silliman's essay \"The New Sentence,\" published in 1977, was a landmark Language manifesto and he remains one of the movement's most compelling, if controversial, theorists.",
    "In 2002, Silliman started a popular blog, which quickly became a vital, comprehensive online repository of innovative American poetry.",
    "At their first meeting, Acker handed him the latest installment of Nymphomaniac.",
    "Silliman was impressed.",
    "It was clear that she was writing fiction, not poetry, and while Silliman was a self-professed snob about novels\u2014why would you want to write one of those, he wondered\u2014he was delighted by the foundational questions she was asking about fiction-making.",
    "\"She was really trying to figure out, 'What is a character?'",
    "'How do you make a character?'",
    "'How does a character acquire a voice or is it the voice that generates the character?'",
    "'How do you get a character through the door given that the door is simply an imagined construct?'",
    "She tore fiction down to its very core.\"",
    "He found it quaint and somewhat romantic too that she was writing her book, or books, one installment a month, and he found himself deliberately going to readings hoping to bump into her and get the next one.",
    "They would eventually sleep together, but she'd always value him more as a friend and confidant.",
    "Her appearance and contradictory affect beguiled him.",
    "She was the first woman he'd seen in San Francisco with hair so short, but he loved her \"good smile,\" and thought she made a point of being attractive and off-putting all at once.",
    "Despite her \"very hard-edged physical presentation,\" and unlike just about every other poet and visual artist he knew, who lived in predictable bohemian squalor, he thought she valued what he called \"a positive, supportive environment around the house.\"",
    "(On Belvedere, that meant old-school comfy hippie trappings: a waterbed, plenty of printed cloth, the pets with their amusing names.)",
    "The attraction went both ways.",
    "Silliman appears frequently as a character in The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec by Henri Toulouse Lautrec, the third and final Black Tarantula book, where an Acker alter-ego named Giannina calls him \"my closest friend in San Francisco.\"",
    "They started going to readings together, taking the Geary Street bus and then disembarking at a mutually convenient intersection where they would stand and talk and flirt for hours.",
    "She was one of the few people he knew in the poetry scene, maybe the only one, who was also interested in what was going on in art and electronic music, and she sometimes took him to those events.",
    "For the final section of Nymphomaniac, she took some documents that Silliman had from his job at the Committee for Prisoner Humanity and Justice, lifting its bureaucratic catalogue of penal procedures and grievances, substituting inmate's names with those of her friends, and essentially publishing it verbatim.",
    "On one occasion, Silliman and Acker were invited to read together at a restaurant on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley.",
    "It was an important reading for Silliman, the public debut of the first section of his book-length poem Ketjak, but Acker, with precocious aplomb, decided she wouldn't read at all.",
    "Instead, she had Gordon, Rich Gold, and Phil Harmonic go up on stage and instructed them to talk about what The Black Tarantula was like as a lover.",
    "\"I think Kathy had something more salacious in mind,\" Silliman remembered, \"but they were all perfect gentlemen.",
    "They all recounted what she had told them to talk about, but they were really not going to talk about their love lives with her.\"",
    "Nonetheless, and with no hard feelings, Silliman quickly realized that he'd been upstaged by Acker's \"marvelous sense of self-mythologization and theater.\"",
    "Acker would soon abandon such stunts, but her readings would always be characterized by that sense of theater.",
    "She treated every reading as a real performance, and she deliberately avoided the expected.",
    "If there was a microphone, she might not use it.",
    "If there was a lectern, she'd stand in front of it or sit on the stage.",
    "At the Western Front in Vancouver, whose performance space used church pews for seating, Acker told the audience that she didn't want anyone to sit in the pews, but rather to come up and sit on the floor with her.",
    "\"I'm a performance artist,\" she said, \"I'm not going to just read from my book.\"",
    "Lynne Tillman, the novelist and critic, first saw Acker read in New York in the late seventies, and remembered one occasion, at a now forgotten restaurant on Third Avenue.",
    "Acker sat on a table in the middle of the room, with people all sitting around her.",
    "She pressed her mouth against the mic, whispering \"sinisterly,\" an effect enhanced by the fact that she was reading about people who were in the same room.",
    "\"She did what she wanted to do,\" said Tillman of Acker's reading style.",
    "\"She took these great liberties.\"",
    "Inspired by that particular event, Tillman started working on a novella she called Weird Fucks.",
    "Many other writers, including Dennis Cooper, Leslie Dick, and Kevin Killian, claimed that Acker taught them how to read their own work in public.",
    "\"If she thought she was losing her audience,\" Killian said, \"instead of speeding up, as you have a tendency to do as you're up there dying, she would slow down to a crawl.",
    "The audience, even if they're bored, says, 'Am I missing something?'",
    "and they really focus in on her.",
    "She would just do it until she had every last person in the room.",
    "No matter what part of the story it was.",
    "It was a trick I learned for the rest of my life.\"",
    "In their novel, Inferno, Eileen Myles similarly captures Acker reading in Germany late in her life: \"Each of us was to read for 8 or 10 minutes and Kathy would read for 21.",
    "And miraculously she didn't kill the room.",
    "I'd watch her going on and on same fucking story.",
    "I'd think how can she do this.",
    "Deadly.",
    "But she was okay.",
    "More than that.",
    "People were riveted.\"",
    "As Acker's career started to take off, Gordon was also moving on to more lucrative creative pastures.",
    "While still enrolled at Mills, he began playing sax in a band called Butch Whacks and the Glass Packs, a \"50s rock-and-roll genre revue\" that toured North America, sometimes opening for the likes of the Doobie Brothers.",
    "During a three-week stint at the Cave in Vancouver, in an ardent, lonely letter, Gordon told Acker about his increasing musical confidence.",
    "\"It's strange,\" he wrote, \"I could be big in rock if I worked at it.",
    "It's really a matter of getting into the drag.\"",
    "That drag would only fit for a short while, though, and he stayed with the band for just six months.",
    "Acker had little patience for that particular scene, burrowing instead into her own work.",
    "She gave a reading with the poet Jim Carroll at Intersection that November, kept working on Nymphomaniac.",
    "Writing the book was exhausting, though, and she found distraction reading Bertolt Brecht and playing with her animals.",
    "By that point, Jill Kroesen had moved to New York, and Acker was starting to think that maybe she should return to the East Coast again too.",
    "\"I now need the input,\" she told Mac Low.",
    "Though she still loved Gordon, she said, their sex life was nonexistent, and it often felt like they were on the verge of or in the midst of a real breakup.",
    "Acker asked Bernadette Mayer if she could arrange a reading for her at St. Mark's, and after some back-and-forth, Acker booked a flight to New York to coincide with the opening of an Eleanor Antin gallery show in mid-January 1975.",
    "Around the same time, Gordon would be in Chicago, where the Glass Packs had a three-week residency at the Playboy Club.",
    "Just before Acker was to leave, though, in December, she received an unexpected letter from Ted Castle and Leandro Katz, the founders of the Vanishing Rotating Triangle Press (TVRT), a tiny New York\u2013based purveyor of poetry by the likes of John Ashbery, C\u00e9sar Vallejo, and Gerard Malanga.",
    "They had been on the Black Tarantula mailing list and wanted to reprint The Childlike Life in a TVRT edition.",
    "Katz admired \"the leaps of language\" in Acker's work and likened her appropriations to the pastiches in the outrageous plays Charles Ludlam produced with his Ridiculous Theatrical Company.",
    "Acker was excited by the offer, but wrote back saying her \"old stuff seems dead to me\" and tried to persuade them instead to publish a new Rip-off Red book titled I Become a Revolutionary.",
    "Castle and Katz stuck to their initial plan, however, and while TVRT editions normally had miniscule print runs\u2014three hundred copies or so\u2014The Childlike Life would be their largest production to date, about a thousand.",
    "It would be a loose arrangement, though; TVRT bought no rights and would pay Acker only in copies of the book.",
    "Still, they were a legitimate publishing house, and Acker was understandably elated.",
    "\"This was special,\" Gordon recalled.",
    "\"They were her first publishers.",
    "\"I Arriving in Manhattan that January, Acker quickly realized that Castle and Katz weren't her only fans.",
    "She now had a certain notoriety in downtown art and literary circles.",
    "In a letter to Silliman, she wrote, \"in SF I thought no one gave a shit about my books here I'm some kind of star.\"",
    "Or, for better or worse, The Black Tarantula was.",
    "An aura of mystery, danger, and sexual aggression clung to the pen name.",
    "Eileen Myles, freshly arrived at St. Mark's themselves, recalled that the Poetry Project was abuzz about \"the legend of The Black Tarantula.\"",
    "At one point, the poet Bill Berkson tried to pick Acker up, telling her that he'd read her writing and knew \"what she wanted.\"",
    "\"My books made everyone think I'm Ms. Cunt,\" she told Silliman, her dismay colored by an irrefutable pride.",
    "Acker would always be equivocal about fame: craving it on the one hand (\"that was her goal,\" Gordon said), but frustrated that she couldn't completely control how it affected her work and life.",
    "Even later, as she more strenuously stage-managed her public image, it always threatened to undermine how seriously her writing was taken, or obscure it completely.",
    "If Acker was becoming an underground star, like many an underground star she was also still broke and alone, with nowhere, really, to live.",
    "She ended up crashing at Mayer's apartment on Second Avenue for more than a month.",
    "It was a somewhat fraught arrangement to begin with, given Mayer's regard for Acker's recent writing and complicated further by Mayer's own domestic dramas (she'd had an affair the previous summer with Anne Waldman and was now involved with Waldman's ex-husband, Lewis Warsh).",
    "Acker was also now between books, somewhat bored with both herself and her writing.",
    "Her first week back, looking for some other artistic outlet, she started attending workshops with Simone Forti, a pioneer of postmodern dance.",
    "She was soon consumed by the work.",
    "It felt good to be out of her head, working with her body, and she supplemented these classes with ones taught by Trisha Brown and Kenneth King, until she was dancing about five hours a day.",
    "In one of Forti's classes, she met Pooh Kaye, a twenty-four-year-old dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker, and also Acker's cousin.",
    "(While growing up, Acker had known Pooh by her birth name, Louise, and it would be years before they realized they were related.)",
    "Kaye had just graduated from Cooper Union and was then making a series of Super 8 films in which she performed, nude, a series of task-like dance movements in a variety of environments.",
    "They became close, and, for a while, Kaye idolized Acker.",
    "\"I was trying to figure out what I was doing,\" she recalled, \"but I was pretty unformed compared to someone like Kathy.\"",
    "They went to openings and parties together\u2014dancer and artist parties being better than dull poet parties\u2014hung out at places like the Locale on Waverly, which Mickey Ruskin opened after departing Max's Kansas City.",
    "After staying with Mayer, and before she found her own place, Acker couch-surfed all over downtown.",
    "She went from staying in Richard \"Rip\" Hayman's apartment above the Ear Inn, a beloved literary-minded dive in the lower Village, to living in the Spring Street loft owned by Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles, which Kaye occasionally cleaned to pay the bills.",
    "Acker told Silliman that Kaye was her \"best girlfriend,\" but soon, she had also befriended another female writer whose work hewed closer to Acker's own.",
    "Constance DeJong was working on her first novel, Modern Love, which she would also start serializing that fall in five installments (and to a mailing list of five hundred) out of the Westbeth office of Performing Artservices, Inc., a nonprofit artists' management firm founded by Bob Ashley's wife, Mimi Johnson.",
    "DeJong, who was dating composer Philip Glass at the time, and who would write the libretto for his Satyagraha, was also keenly interested in the performance of her writing and would later become renowned for readings where she recited her prose from memory.",
    "Modern Love was elliptical and dissonant, part detective story, part postmodern historical romance, both a downtown cousin of Renata Adler's Speedboat and an American version of the nouveau roman.",
    "DeJong lived near Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, and she and Acker began meeting regularly for coffee and to talk shop.",
    "They were very different people, with very different backgrounds and personalities.",
    "DeJong was less social, more reserved, but she spent most of her time with composers and performers, and was delighted to find another prose writer with whom to discuss technical aspects of the form\u2014verb tenses, narrative construction, and the like.",
    "\"It was not a conversation I had with anyone else,\" she remembered.",
    "\"We were people of language and people of words.\"",
    "DeJong thought Acker's \"polyphonic voice\" was entirely unique, that she was \"doing things with language that other people had not done.\"",
    "She was equally impressed with how devotional Acker was to her writing.",
    "\"She was a dead-serious person.",
    "Writing was everything.",
    "And she was always working.",
    "It wasn't as boring as, 'Oh, she had a work ethic.'",
    "It was much more driven than that\u2014she was an extremely driven person.\"",
    "Acker similarly gushed about DeJong to Silliman: \"an incredible writer [who] I feel I can learn a lot from her writing it's incredibly precise i.e.",
    "so transparent.\"",
    "They shared their respective literary enthusiasms (Acker: Burroughs, Genet; DeJong: Stein, Duras, late Woolf), and at one meeting, Acker gave DeJong a copy of Violette Leduc's gossipy, self-abnegating memoir Mad in Pursuit.",
    "DeJong could see immediately what Acker had gleaned from the French writer\u2014\"the relentless voice of the struggling, self-obsessed Leduc persona, hyperbolizing her encounters.\"",
    "Acker and DeJong were united as well in their opposition to what, decades later, DeJong called \"the gatekeepers\" of commercial publishing.",
    "\"Kathy and I were like, 'Fuck the gatekeepers.'",
    "The gatekeepers of what?",
    "Some old-fashioned idea of what the novel is?",
    "I know I wasn't going to seek that approval or wait for it.",
    "I was acquainted, as was Kathy, with a number of artists who were older than we were and who were very can-do people very good at finding a way to have visibility.",
    "The music people did that.",
    "The dance people did that.",
    "The film people did that.",
    "Steve Reich and Philip Glass were not waiting for Lincoln Center to come calling.",
    "They went out into the world.\"",
    "The world those artists went to, or more often ushered into being themselves, was a rapidly expanding array of artist-run centers, performance spaces, and nightclubs that bloomed throughout the drear hothouse of 1970s lower Manhattan.",
    "Nineteen seventy-five was the year that New York officially teetered into economic chaos, when President Gerald Ford famously told the city to \"drop dead,\" denying it federal bailout money.",
    "It was, as DeJong writes in Modern Love, \"a city lost and beaten and full of emptiness.\"",
    "But the ubiquity of massive, cheap work spaces, lack of police and bureaucratic oversight, and a seemingly insatiable hunger for artistic collaboration led to an unprecedented surge of cultural activity.",
    "It helped too that the art world was relatively small and concentrated\u2014a grungy, scrambling, and interbred village.",
    "\"There are two hundred thousand artists in New York now,\" Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer said.",
    "\"Then there were two hundred.",
    "The news went very fast.\"",
    "The Kitchen, a performance and video art space, had opened in 1971 in the literal former kitchen of the Mercer Arts Center and by 1974 had moved to its own digs at Wooster and Broome streets in SoHo.",
    "Richard Foreman, the legendary experimental playwright and impresario, formed his own theater in a narrow loft at Broadway and Broome.",
    "Burgeoning institutions like the Franklin Furnace, Artists Space, Printed Matter, the Franklin Street Arts Center, and the Institute for Art and Urban Resources (later P.S.1), all of which opened their doors around the same period, provided emerging and alternative artists with money, company, and a home.",
    "With some excitement, Acker told Silliman about 112 Greene Street, a six-story, 24/7, art laboratory-cum-gallery created by artist Gordon Matta-Clark and a sculptor and self-described anarchist named Jeffrey Lew: \"this guy named Jeffrey Lew is setting up a downtown Lincoln Center one floor of which will be devoted to printing & he's promised Connie [Constance DeJong] she will have full control of the printing press which means I can too.\"",
    "While formerly desolate SoHo was being transformed and redefined by visual artists in the mid-seventies, the denser and more impoverished East Village and Lower East Side, meanwhile, nurtured a more literary and theatrical pedigree.",
    "As Alan Moore and Jim Cornwell put it in Alternative Art New York, those neighborhoods constituted a \"poet's district\u2026 thick with the forms and attitudes of previous cultural moments.\"",
    "In other words, as Edmund White wrote of the period, \"Then, there were only possibilities.\"",
    "Those possibilities would later be mythologized to the point of clich\u00e9, but many of the artists who imagined them, who nurtured them, who lived through them, do nonetheless recall the time with affection.",
    "\"It was such a playground,\" Pooh Kaye said of the city.",
    "\"It was so bankrupt, so formless.",
    "Anybody could put their own ambitions on top of it.",
    "You could make art anywhere.\"",
    "Lynne Tillman, who had just returned from several years in Europe and would soon befriend Acker too, was similarly intoxicated.",
    "\"I think we are all very interested in what was happening at that moment,\" she said.",
    "\"There was a lot going on.",
    "There was a lot of stuff to go to see.",
    "There was a lot of loft parties.",
    "There was a collision of people downtown.\"",
    "With New York largely broke too, the market didn't really dictate what kind of work was being made; there was no real market, no pie to fight over.",
    "Artists woke up, had an idea, then grabbed their like-minded friends and cobbled together enough resources to make it.",
    "Then they moved on to the next thing.",
    "The writer Lucy Sante summed it all up perfectly: \"1975 is a new world, somehow [\u2026] the year is a laboratory.\"",
    "Acker, for her part, was of two minds about all this.",
    "\"There never was a better time,\" she said, with genuine nostalgia, many years later.",
    "\"The community was absolutely strong.",
    "All my friendships have really come from that time.\"",
    "But in the moment, she alternated between enthusiasm and revulsion for the scene.",
    "She found the attention she personally received both thrilling and confusing, and she wasn't quite sure how to navigate the social dynamics of the art world.",
    "The male artists, whom she often derided as macho cowboys, were sexually aggressive.",
    "Though many people were interested in her work, she didn't always feel that enthusiastic about theirs.",
    "To her mind, artists like Vito Acconci were more or less over, and the new art that she was seeing in SoHo\u2014the gallery stuff, at least\u2014was tepid: \"none of it dangerous or with any social implications.\"",
    "She also claimed to hate the overweening competition of the art scene, what she called \"the Protestant work ethic, the real a-political coldness of the artists.\"",
    "But even she knew this was disingenuous.",
    "After just a short time back in New York, she had become even more conscious of the art world's hierarchies, the shifting strata of cultural capital, and how this shaped both the content and reception of art.",
    "Acker herself gleefully participated in this pecking order.",
    "She and Mel Freilicher \"graded\" the St. Mark's poets as A, B, C, or D and, at one point, even wrote out a flow chart detailing how these people could help them become famous.",
    "\"It involved befriending (sucking up to) x-number of A-list people,\" Freilicher remembered.",
    "\"You were allowed\u2014even required to\u2014alienate a small number of people on the B- and C-lists but only after fulfilling A-list requirements.",
    "It was a lot of fun.\"",
    "Acker also worked just as hard as anyone else, probably harder.",
    "It was a matter of \"survival,\" though, she told Silliman.",
    "\"Here art is ART WORK IMPORTANT.",
    "There ain't nothing else.\"",
    "Where else was she going to go, though?",
    "There weren't a lot of places for a writer like her.",
    "She told Silliman he should move there.",
    "And then, she went and got an actual job.",
    "Taking tickets a couple nights a week at the Kitchen, she made $15 a week.",
    "It was, she said, \"about the only job I've ever had that I like.\"",
    "I.",
    "With Printed Matter, TVRT later copublished different editions of both The Childlike Life and Toulouse Lautrec, with covers created by Katz and William Wegman, respectively.",
    "Katz believed the arrangement was the result of an affair between Acker and Sol LeWitt, a cofounder of Printed Matter, a rumor almost impossible to substantiate.",
    "(I asked Lawrence Weiner, who knew LeWitt well, and he could neither deny nor confirm, saying only that \"Sol was a Don Juan and Kathy had round heels.\")",
    "In any case, TVRT received no compensation from this collaboration, and Katz felt that Acker never cared enough to intervene on TVRT's behalf.",
    "Because of this rift, he wouldn't speak to her for years.",
    "GORDON VISITED NEW YORK IN February, but returned to California soon after; he'd continue to go back and forth while he toured and finished up his MFA.",
    "At some point, he and Acker had officially broken up, but they would still remain a couple, sharing an apartment again many months later.",
    "Acker was pleased with herself, though, that she hadn't, as she'd done in the past, immediately traded one heavy relationship for another.",
    "She was still meeting and getting involved with people\u2014for sex, for company, for connections\u2014but none of these relationships really had the intensity or drama of her previous ones.",
    "While still living at Mayer's, Acker hooked up with a twenty-three-year-old musician named Rhys Chatham, who also worked at Tin Pan Alley, a Times Square bar popular with jazz musicians, strippers, and artists, and was the Kitchen's first musical director.",
    "Chatham first met Acker at St. Mark's and was, like others, initially cowed by The Black Tarantula's fearsome reputation.",
    "While he soon got over this first impression, calling Acker in hindsight \"an absolute sweetheart,\" he remained somewhat shocked by what he considered her libertinism.",
    "Even in an era of unbridled sexual promiscuity, Chatham felt that she \"really did sleep with everyone,\" and had a particular fondness, he said, for younger men like himself.",
    "At the time, Acker was still, for better or worse, largely dependent on Gordon for financial and emotional support, both of which allowed her to write, but Chatham thought she also required fresh infusions of romantic adventure to fuel her work.",
    "\"She was a poet,\" he said.",
    "\"When she fell in love with one person or another, she was inspired to write.\"",
    "Her female friends, who were sometimes collateral damage in her carnal pursuits, were more curt.",
    "They didn't care that she slept around\u2014that was practically a given in their circles\u2014but they didn't appreciate her open disregard for their feelings or attachments.",
    "\"She slept with every man I knew,\" Pooh Kaye said.",
    "\"She'd co-opt people's boyfriends, husbands, lovers, anyone they had crushes on.",
    "It was a thing she did.",
    "At a party, she went after a guy I was interested in right in front of my face.",
    "It was unreal.\"",
    "Another friend, the artist Aline Mare, who was dating sculptor Richard Serra at the time, had a similar recollection: \"I'd see her at parties, where she just zoomed in on someone.",
    "It didn't matter if they came in together, and they were obviously a team.",
    "She would just direct her sexual and intellectual prowess.",
    "Like an animal, almost.\"",
    "Even the poet Eileen Myles, then still, in their words, \"actively heterosexual,\" experienced Acker this way.",
    "\"For several years,\" Myles said, \"I was fucking people who Kathy had just fucked.\"",
    "One night, the two of them were at Arcadia, a pizza joint frequented by the poetry crowd, sitting in a booth with two men.",
    "Myles, who was relatively friendly with Acker, recalled her refusing to even meet Myles's gaze, essentially treating Myles as if they weren't there.",
    "Acker wasn't particularly enraptured by Chatham\u2014\"he's more idiotic and childish and selfish than me,\" she told Silliman, \"[though] we get along well\"\u2014but she did scribble this note to herself on the back cover of the first notebook she used for The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec by Toulouse Lautrec: \"Reality: I admire Rhys because he has power\u2026 I don't fall in love w/ men just who are nice to me.",
    "Power = able to survive.\"",
    "What power did Chatham possess, in her mind?",
    "A sexual power?",
    "Perhaps she meant the cultural and social capital he had, owing to his role at the Kitchen and his growing reputation in the downtown music scene.",
    "As Chatham had divined, several of Acker's relationships, as is the case with so many ambitious people, had been driven, and would continue to be driven, by how useful a lover could be to her.",
    "Or how they helped her discover and cultivate different parts of herself.",
    "Ron Silliman concurred: \"It was clear that she really treated sexual relationships, instrumentally, career-wise.\"",
    "Power and sex too were inextricable for her.",
    "\"I think they were utterly connected in her mind,\" said her friend Betsy Sussler, the editor of BOMB magazine.",
    "A few months after her relationship with Chatham began, Acker would watch filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow, a close acquaintance when the latter was in the graduate film program at Columbia, publicly pursue the older French intellectual Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy at a Semiotext(e) event.",
    "When a somewhat appalled Acker asked her why, Bigelow smiled and said, \"Power, baby, power.\"",
    "It was a story that Acker loved to tell, though rarely, if ever, acknowledging that she might also be talking about herself.",
    "\"She was a skilled tactician around power,\" Eileen Myles said.",
    "\"That's what she was interested in.\"",
    "Sussler, who during their friendship found Acker heartbreakingly lonely and vulnerable, thought that Acker's relationship to, or understanding of, power was more complicated than that, particularly when it came to her sex life.",
    "\"She wanted to be sublimated, subsumed and consumed,\" Sussler said, \"and yet she wanted to have power over [men].",
    "She wasn't a femme fatale.\"",
    "As all this testimony suggests, sex was of profound, complicated, and sometimes confusing importance to Acker, and would remain so for the rest of her life.",
    "On the one hand, her fascination was crude and simple\u2014as she would put it, she really liked to get fucked.",
    "And she could become bored quickly by her lovers.",
    "But it didn't end there.",
    "As literary territory, sex was incredibly rich, a limitless zone within which she could theorize about bodies, desire, performance, affect.",
    "Sex was her favorite topic, she said, describing herself as a \"fanatic.\"",
    "It contained both narrative\u2014expectation, tension, release\u2014and poetry\u2014seduction, rhythm, fluidity.",
    "Its pleasures could be transcendent and its disappointments crippling, a dialectic that Acker never tired of revisiting.",
    "It was also, finally, the corporeal expression of love\u2014irrational love, fascistic love, devotional love\u2014which never stopped being her great subject.",
    "\"These writings are the fuels of love,\" she wrote in My Death My Life by Pier Paolo Pasolini.",
    "\"Each statement is the absolute truth\u2014and an absolute lie\u2014because I'm always changing.\"",
    "Acker's love life, at many points, could seem almost indiscriminate.",
    "Her lovers were formidable intellectuals and accomplished artists, but just as often they were feckless poets, sycophantic students, and middle-of-the-road journalists.",
    "Physical attractiveness wasn't always a big deal to her either; some friends thought she had terrible taste.",
    "Boyfriends, husbands, and lovers were useful as material.",
    "In almost all her books, Acker includes figures based on real people, with various degrees of fidelity.",
    "Acker, however, never pretended that her characters were anything more than textual playthings, configurations in a composition within which to situate ideas or simulate voices, reliable shorthand to specific emotional effects.",
    "In some cases, these characters bore little more than their real-life analog's name; at other times, they were lightly drawn facsimiles.",
    "Silliman became a character in The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec, as did Chatham.",
    "Chatham was delighted to be used in such a manner, but Silliman had a somewhat more complex reaction.",
    "He first thought that Acker's description of him as \"gentle\" was, for her, an insult.",
    "Years later, though, re-reading lines like \"Ron's a great poet: His varied sensuous language reflects and questions itself,\" he would come to see how affectionate this thumbnail portrait was.",
    "\"She made me out to be a better person than I was,\" Silliman said.",
    "Acker started Toulouse Lautrec in May, around the same time TVRT was publishing The Childlike Life.",
    "The new book was less about herself, or about Acker trying to excavate herself, as human being, text, or author, and more about an exploration of genre and \"myth.\"",
    "Throughout Acker's career, \"myth\" would be a complex, mercurial word in her vocabulary but which mainly meant a kind of overarching discourse or narrative.",
    "Aside from Silliman, Chatham, and, again, Peter Gordon, the book teems with historical, real-life figures: the titular disfigured French painter; Van Gogh; Jacqueline Onassis; James Dean; Janis Joplin; Henry Kissinger.",
    "Dean, according to Acker, represented the \"myth\" of the 1950s, Joplin the '60s, and Kissinger the '70s.",
    "It also churns through several familiar narrative modes and styles\u2014art history, Agatha Christie mystery, fable, porn, Hollywood film, tabloid newspaper, and crime biography\u2014while also employing Acker's now signature maneuvers: shifting genders, appropriation, the incessant emphasis on power and sex.",
    "Acker wanted to figure out, she said, how to engage a hegemonic, mainstream culture, which she called \"the jailer,\" and transform its meaning or its relationship to \"us\"\u2014us being the marginalized, the poor, artists.",
    "\"I'm all excited by my new book,\" she told Silliman, \"which everyone will hate it's what I've always wanted to do.\"",
    "While still far more concerned with ideas, she was also becoming, in her own way, more interested in the usual architecture of fiction: story and plot.",
    "While dismissive of mainstream contemporaries such as Joyce Carol Oates, she raved to Silliman about writers like Thomas Pynchon: \"God Pynchon's a good writer!",
    "I see how much I have to learn.",
    "I'm still so awkward & slow & uncourageous.",
    "I do things too slowly.",
    "I mean he has such a range!\"",
    "She found further inspiration in a more unlikely source\u2014bestselling schlockmeister Harold Robbins.",
    "As always, she scorned any distinction between so-called high and low culture, and happily read (and borrowed from) writers and genres\u2014porn and pulp fiction, most obviously\u2014that her more snobby colleagues tended to shun.",
    "Robbins knew the power of a good story as well as the power of a good fake biography\u2014he famously concocted his own outlandish rags-to-riches backstory.",
    "And, similar to Acker, albeit to much different effect, he stole his epic plots and larger-than-life characters from real life, fictionalizing everyone from Frank Sinatra to pornographer Larry Flynt.",
    "As Acker told Silliman, reading Robbins was positively revolutionary for her:             Took to reading J. Suzanne[sic] H. Robbins I. Wallace the last week with the idea that I've been reading everything the avant-garde's done and everything by dead writers but I have no idea what non-avant garde stuff's been done in this country in past 25 years\u2026 Robbins turns out to be the main interest and a large one: his use of fact/fiction business, especially not especially actually in everything I've read so far, the conception of writing as its existence based on audience: reaction so the dealing with anticipation, expectation, maneuvering, etc.",
    "all this in relation to American politics and existence, use of story narrative as myth (a source of common energy information) that again has politics advertising conceptual basis, and the information!",
    "A range that no avant garde person has touched, and a new way my writing opens.",
    "Acker lifted four pages from Robbins's 1974 potboiler The Pirate, itself loosely based on the life of flamboyant billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and folded them into The Adult Life.",
    "Whether in tribute or merely, as she said, for \"the information,\" the gesture was both innocent and inspired.",
    "\"Robbins is really soft core porn,\" she later said, \"so I wanted to see what would happen if you changed contexts and just upped the sexuality of the language.",
    "It's a very simplistic example of deconstruction.\"",
    "As entirely different as Acker and Robbins's aesthetics and ambitions may have been, the two writers were united, improbably, in their attempts to capture the unstable interplay of the real and the imaginary and the grotesque machinations of the culture.",
    "Robbins had figured out how to make himself rich off of such attempts.",
    "Acker, meanwhile, was, in her words, \"just some nut who piddles around with these problems to amuse and teach herself.\"",
    "In the spring of 1975, Gordon moved back to New York more or less for good, and he and Acker sublet Constance DeJong's apartment while the latter spent the summer in India.",
    "Acker had her own room, which she decorated with books, vivid yellow-and-orange Mexican fabrics, and a foam pad draped with a white silk quilt.",
    "\"This slum will have to do,\" she told Silliman.",
    "She told him too that there were \"about four guys I sleep with now and then.\"",
    "One of these relationships was more meaningful than the rest.",
    "Through Aline Mare, she had met the writer Rudy Wurlitzer, a friend of Richard Serra's and Philip Glass's.",
    "Wurlitzer was a novelist and screenwriter with an appealingly gnomic aura.",
    "By that point, he'd already published three acclaimed books, each a distinctive, haunting blend of minimalism and psychedelia, as well as the original screenplays for Monte Hellman's Two-Lane Blacktop, the entirety of which had been printed in Esquire, and Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid.",
    "Acker was clearly drawn to his fame\u2014he was another example of someone who had found success on his own terms\u2014but their romance was agonizing from the start.",
    "Acker referred to them as \"best friends,\" and she clearly wanted more from the relationship than he did.",
    "But every time they slept together, usually at Wurlitzer's run-down apartment on East 23rd, Wurlitzer would \"freak out\" because Acker was still living with Gordon and then he would distance himself from her.",
    "\"He's been burned before,\" she told Silliman.",
    "In Wurlitzer's recollection, however, they were little more than fuck buddies.",
    "Decades later, he said that, while he admired the \"passionate integrity\" of Acker's work, he never thought of them as a couple, nor was there ever the promise that they would become so.",
    "The attraction for him was almost purely erotic\u2014\"We both seemed to hit each other's windshields at the same time.\"",
    "Their correspondence, however, suggested the relationship was considerably more intense and intimate, at least in the moment.",
    "When Wurlitzer later decamped for Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where he was living with Robert Frank and collaborating on his film Keep Busy, he wrote Acker several letters\u2014long, pained, portentous discussions about what their romance meant and didn't mean, his distaste for the New York art and literary worlds, his own spiritual anomie.",
    "About to turn forty, Wurlitzer could be as much of a drama queen as Acker.",
    "For her part, Acker seemed to crave his literary and intellectual guidance.",
    "She would occasionally dismiss her own writing and was for the moment obsessed with Japanese writers like Yukio Mishima and Yasunari Kawabata, told Wurlitzer that she aspired to their elegance: \"simple paragraphs, each paragraph an image.",
    "1, 2, 3.",
    "The flow absolutely like a straight line.\"",
    "Acker applied for a grant from Creative Artists Public Service (CAPS), administered by the New York State Council on the Arts.",
    "If she got the money, she was thinking of using it to head somewhere warm, either Florida or Haiti, and then, the following summer, to Nova Scotia and Wurlitzer.",
    "That latter trip would never happen; by then, Wurlitzer was spending more and more time in Paris and Hollywood.",
    "In the early eighties, he would give Acker a copy of his novel-in-progress, Slow Fade, and though it wasn't her style\u2014\"he sets Hollywood bland language deals against Tibetan-Indian gorgeous searchings\"\u2014reading it, she said, felt like she was \"touching Rudy's naked body.\"",
    "Soon after, though, and to Acker's dismay, Wurlitzer lost all contact with her.",
    "\"We disappeared into separate worlds,\" he said.",
    "Romantic angst rarely interfered with Acker's writing, however, and she worked throughout, further prodded by the example of Harold Robbins's productivity.",
    "\"Even a hack novelist works an eight-hour day,\" she said.",
    "All her labor began to pay off.",
    "In July, she received her first real press coverage.",
    "In the July 4\u201310 edition of the Berkeley Barb, Loren Means published a glowing review of the TVRT edition of The Childlike Life headlined \"Kathy's Genius.",
    "\"I The review compared and contrasted Acker's book with Andrei Codrescu's The Life and Times of an Involuntary Genius, concluding, \"So Andrei will probably be a star\u2014his work is fun, and doesn't threaten.",
    "And Kathy will probably remain as she is\u2014pissed off and brilliant, and so scary.\"",
    "On July 21, Acker and Gordon performed at the Poetry Project, and the Project's newsletter advertised The Adult Life: \"The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec is the most recent outgrowth from the overactive cranium of the Black Tarantula, alias Kathy Acker.",
    "This adorable little sex & mayhem pamphlet is available for a dollar, change, c/o The Project.\"",
    "To Acker's delight and surprise, even the New Yorker took notice of this reading, including her in an August 4th \"Talk of the Town\": \"The Black Tarantula, a young white woman with short brown hair, read excerpts from her new novel to fifty people at St. Mark's In-the-Bouwerie Episcopal Church.",
    "There's a murder in the book, which takes place in Montmartre in 1886.",
    "The characters include Vincent van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Hercule Poirot, left for dead hours earlier at Publishers Weekly.\"",
    "Later that winter, in the December 29, 1975, issue of the Village Voice, Richard Goldstein listed Acker in a roundup of the year's best writers, with an accompanying photo and blurb which read \"she has produced a stream of seminarrative prose, culled from raw data and her own sense of melodrama.\"",
    "At the bottom of the same page was none other than Andy Warhol, whose The Philosophy of Andy Warhol had come out earlier that year.",
    "At last, she was in the company she had so long craved.",
    "I.",
    "The paper listed the publisher as Viper's Tongue, which was essentially Leandro Katz's imprint at TVRT (conceived originally in Peru in 1961).",
    "After TVRT's demise, he would continue to use the imprint\u2014\"my seal,\" he called it\u2014whenever he published anything of his own.",
    "AFTER DEJONG RETURNED FROM INDIA that fall, Acker and Gordon found their own place, at 341 East Fifth Street, between First and Second, near the police station.",
    "A quintessential East Village railroad apartment, it was dark and cramped, with a kitchen and bathtub in the back, two corridor rooms, and a main bedroom in the front.",
    "Acker took the front bedroom, filling it with manuscripts and so many books that a friend joked there were \"about seventy-two thousand.\"",
    "Roaches were such a routine nuisance you couldn't open a book or the fridge, which just barely worked, without a couple scurrying out.",
    "At one point, when Freilicher was visiting, the ceiling in the main room collapsed, sending plaster and dust everywhere.",
    "The East Village itself was a dangerous ruin, prostitution and drug use rampant, the membrane between bohemia and underworld exceedingly thin.",
    "Their rent was $150 a month, something they still found tough to make.",
    "While Gordon was gigging and trying to put together his own bands and projects, he worked in radio production, cutting tape and other audio work.",
    "Acker's paycheck from the Kitchen was still small enough that she was eligible for food stamps, and in a letter to Silliman she enumerated the meager contents of their fridge: \"eight eggs, a bit of butter, a carrot, tea, and half a daikon.\"",
    "At some point, Lawrence Weiner\u2014\"one of the nicest artists around,\" as Acker called him\u2014gave her an emergency thirty-five bucks.",
    "Just as Acker had, Gordon threw himself into downtown's various cultural scenes.",
    "Despite Chatham's initial jealousy toward him, the two became fast friends and collaborators.",
    "Gordon also reunited with Jill Kroesen, who was working with Arthur Russell, a pop-art musician and composer who'd been a lover of both Allen Ginsberg and Kevin Killian.",
    "Since coming back to New York\u2014in an illustration of just how small and incestuous the scene really was\u2014Kroesen had fallen in love with and married Acker's ex, Lenny Neufeld.",
    "The same month that Acker and Gordon appeared at St. Mark's, Kroesen and Neufeld performed there too.",
    "With Chatham, Russell, and other like-minded musicians, Gordon began forming ad-hoc ensembles, playing the Kitchen, Artists Space, and other venues, eventually forming the Love of Life Orchestra, a renowned conceptual pop band that included Kroesen, Chatham, Russell, David Van Tieghem, \"Blue\" Gene Tyranny, Laurie Anderson, David Byrne from time to time, and Acker herself.",
    "The band's first record, which they released in 1978 on Mimi Johnson's label, Lovely Music, was the wryly titled Star Jaws.",
    "As Gordon found his footing in the art-music world, Acker was finishing up Toulouse Lautrec and thinking ahead toward bigger projects.",
    "She was still sending the serials to subscribers on her mailing list\u2014it now numbered about five hundred people, she said\u2014but she was weary of scrambling for printers and the money to pay them.",
    "\"I want to do a big novel,\" she told an interviewer.",
    "\"I've changed.\"",
    "She felt she'd arrived at the end of the intellectual puzzles she was exploring in the book.",
    "\"The problem of identity had become too complex,\" she wrote a decade later, \"and, at the same time, had resolved itself.",
    "I realized that identity is made, the legend of Daedalus is true, and perhaps of Icarus, that when one writes, one doesn't express true or false identity, truth or falsity, one makes identity.\"",
    "The identity that Acker was making, or at least asserting, was one that was increasingly aggressive, even cutthroat.",
    "Her former complaints about the competitiveness of the art world started to sound hollow, as she began to see other writers, particularly young, female writers exploring similarly innovative terrain, as an existential threat.",
    "Even mutually beneficial alliances could be sabotaged, or heedlessly discarded.",
    "In January 1976, she and DeJong persuaded the Kitchen to allow them to perform on a double bill later that month.",
    "Heretofore, the venue had had no literary programming, welcoming only performance artists, dancers, and musicians to its stage\u2014its official name at the time was the Kitchen Center for Video and Music\u2014but Acker and DeJong argued that they too were performers of a sort.",
    "\"It was a big deal,\" DeJong recalled.",
    "\"A lot of people would come to the Kitchen.\"",
    "Acker decided to stage a candlelit reading, with Laurie Anderson and Jill Kroesen, of a new short story she'd titled \"Florida,\" a loose adaptation of Maxwell Anderson's play Key Largo, which had been turned into the John Huston film of the same name.",
    "She'd written it, she said, when a PID flare-up left her in bed for three weeks.",
    "\"I had a strong, undeniable urge to read the script for Key Largo,\" she remembered.",
    "\"Such a script was not to be found, at least by me in my bed.",
    "So I did the next best thing, I wrote this script according to my memory.",
    "A memory of holes, like those landscapes I love the most.\"",
    "DeJong meanwhile performed sections of Modern Love, accompanied by prerecorded musical elements and another person voicing one of the characters.",
    "In the Kitchen's press release, Acker was listed first and DeJong second.",
    "But just before the 8:30 event was to start, Acker took DeJong aside and said that they needed to talk about which order they would go on.",
    "The thought hadn't occurred to DeJong, but it was clearly something that Acker had given ample consideration to.",
    "\"I'll just tell you that you don't want to go second,\" she said to DeJong.",
    "\"Because what I'm doing is so amazing, you cannot follow.\"",
    "DeJong was shocked.",
    "When did her friend transform into her rival?",
    "The floor, she remembered, seemed to open up beneath her.",
    "Suddenly, she saw the dark side of Acker's drive.",
    "\"That was Kathy's first move to winnow me out,\" DeJong said.",
    "\"She just had to exclude me from her existence in this kind of totalizing, brutal way.\"",
    "Whatever Acker's reasons, it was apparent that she didn't just need attention, she needed all the attention.",
    "After that reading, the two women never really spoke again.",
    "When they were in the same room, Acker would look the other way.",
    "On the road, when people would ask Acker about DeJong, in a what-happened-to-her kind of way, Acker would lie and say that DeJong had given up writing.",
    "Even worse, she would tell people that she, Acker, had taught her everything she knew.",
    "A couple years later, when the Village Voice was promoting a reading that she and DeJong were to give on behalf of photographer-writer Anne Turyn's Top Stories\u2014a popular series of downtown chapbooks (\"a prose periodical\") by women writers published between 1978 and 1991\u2014Acker refused to participate in an accompanying photograph if DeJong was also going to be included.",
    "Even after that, at another event, DeJong, intent on burying the hatchet, approached Acker and tried to talk to her.",
    "But Acker was capable of sustaining hostilities for a long time\u2014she turned her back on DeJong again.",
    "Decades later, the rejection and animosity still rankled and perplexed DeJong.",
    "\"When you maintain a whole constellation of grudges and enmities and make enemies of people,\" DeJong said, \"that's a lot of burden to hold around in your head.\"",
    "What compelled such abruptly hard-hearted behavior?",
    "Was it borne out of a misplaced sense of self-preservation, a matter of, as she so often put it to Silliman, survival?",
    "Eileen Myles, who could be, by their own admission, a relatively driven person, even \"manipulative,\" recognized the possible necessity of Acker's cunning, even as they found it noxious and vaguely preposterous in the relatively genteel poetry world.",
    "\"Rock 'n' roll, art, theater people\u2014they're all unabashed ambition, all about winning, and getting it,\" Myles said.",
    "\"Kathy had that.",
    "She was on a climb.",
    "She was such a cunt.",
    "But the fact is, she got up every fucking day and wrote.",
    "It was her religion.",
    "That's why she was here.",
    "That's awesome.",
    "That's awesome for a woman.",
    "It's awesome for a woman to say, I have that, and then deliver.\"",
    "Other people, of course, took a more dim view.",
    "\"I think she felt intellectually superior to other people,\" Pooh Kaye said.",
    "\"And she'd just drop them.",
    "They'd become uninteresting.\"",
    "Jill Kroesen saw something even more insidious.",
    "Even though Acker had ditched Neufeld and obviously had her hands full, sexually speaking, once he and Kroesen married, Acker still made attempts to seduce him again.",
    "\"I think she was dangerous,\" Kroesen said.",
    "\"It was just take, take, take, take, take.",
    "And if you really let her, she just would hurt you.\"",
    "But Kroesen came back, again, to Acker's childhood, blaming her \"abandonment\" for what she considered an almost sociopathic cruelty.",
    "\"I think that her pain was so severe,\" she said.",
    "\"I think she was doing whatever she could to get rid of the pain.",
    "She was desperate.\"",
    "Acker was so often conflicted about her own writing\u2014entirely convinced of its importance one day, self-deprecating about it the next\u2014that perhaps the only position she could consistently sustain was one of embattlement.",
    "It was also maybe the professional analog to a pattern that Freilicher saw play out in her romantic relationships.",
    "In the early days of a new romance, she tended to idolize a paramour, catering to their every need, acting, in her words, like a \"geisha.\"",
    "Soon, however, she would turn self-protective and selfish.",
    "Her work, as always, would again become her first priority; her needs would take absolute precedence.",
    "\"She felt like she was kind of deceiving people about who she was,\" Freilicher said, \"and made it impossible when they found out because they wanted her to be the geisha.\"",
    "Whatever the case, the break with DeJong was only the first such rift that Acker would have with her literary peers\u2014mostly women, but occasionally men too.",
    "As her career unfolded, there would be several other rivalries, grudges, and quarrels, often over the most trivial differences or slights.",
    "With other female writers, she was often at first solicitous and supportive, helping them to secure publishers, providing blurbs for their books.",
    "But she could retract that support as soon as she felt imperiled.",
    "As her own fame grew, it seemed that the only other writers she could tolerate for long were young, emerging, and preferably fawning ones, or those who were more famous or powerful than she.",
    "Sometime in the early to mid-nineties, Acker drew up a document, seemingly never published, that she titled \"Ten Out of Many Women Writers.\"",
    "The list, which actually included eleven writers, opens with this preface: \"This is a list of writers who are female whose work matters to me.",
    "It isn't a list of the women writers whose work matters the most to me, for I don't think nor feel in that way\u2014so absolutely and judgementally.",
    "And it's a list of the writers, rather than of works, for it's the writer's work throughout time, a lifetime, the process rather than any individual work that interests me.\"",
    "She divided the list into two categories, \"The Older Ones\" and \"Contemporaries (briefly).\"",
    "The older ones included (in order) Jane Austen, George Sand, George Eliot, and Gertrude Stein (\"the mother of us all,\" Acker wrote also, alluding to the title of the Virgil Thomson opera for which Stein wrote the libretto).",
    "On the contemporaries list: Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, Luce Irigaray, Christa Wolf, Marguerite Duras, Maya Deren, and Emily Bront\u00eb (\"for wildness\").",
    "Despite Bront\u00eb's eccentric inclusion, Acker obviously meant contemporaries in a temporal sense.",
    "But it was telling that, unless you count the naturalized Arendt, only one of these contemporary writers was American (Deren), and none were, in any real sense, her contemporaries.",
    "Literary success, to Acker, was a zero-sum, take-no-prisoners game."
