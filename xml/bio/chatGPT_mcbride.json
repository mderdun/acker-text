        "original": "She was born Karen Alexander in Manhattan at 7:05 a.m. on April 18, 1947. From the outset, at least according to Acker, things were difficult\u2014she was born premature, underweight, ugly. But, as in a fairy tale, her difficulties, her pain, began long before her birth. Acker's grandmother's family, on her mother's side, were the Greenfields, who arrived in New York from Austria in the 1870s or 1880s, and owned a butcher shop on York Avenue on the Upper East Side. Her grandmother, Florence (known as Florrie to friends and family, Nana to her grandchildren) was the oldest of three daughters, born on July 4, 1883. She married Albert Weill, a businessman who owned a glove manufacturing business in Manhattan. Acker's cousin, Pooh Kaye, believed that the family was affluent, upwardly mobile, bourgeois, and ambitious. But like many, they saw their wealth plummet when the stock market crashed in 1929. \"We were the grandchildren of nouveau riche immigrants who lost most of their investments during the Depression,\" she said. Little else is known about the family's early years, and in Acker's own writing\u2014a comprehensive but not always reliable record\u2014some of those details are misremembered or obscured. In an early draft of her novel Don Quixote, Acker writes:\n                My father's and my mother's family're both from Alsace-Lorraine and Jewish. I know nothing else about my father's family. My mother's mother, her two sisters, and her mother and father came over to America when my grandmother was young, in about 1900. Though rich in the old country, they couldn't bring their wealth to America. (Am I making up these details?) I don't know why. Nana (my grandmother) must have detested being poor because in her late adolescence, she told me she's now inordinately (that's my word: hers is very) proud of having started a successful millinery shop. The millinery shop was in Brooklyn. Being in the shop introduced her, when she was 30 years old, to her first and only husband. (These dates don't match.) \"I waited until I found the right man.\" The right man ran the American ladies' glove business. According to Acker, Albert Weill died in 1950, and Florrie never remarried. But she was, and remained, a force: statuesque, commanding, intimidating. She was financially canny, a regular player of the stock market, but could also be miserly. When she was a child, Kaye said, Florrie would send her and her brothers just a single dollar bill for Christmas (a gift that later became $5, plus a box of Kathy's expensive hand-me-downs). Florrie's younger sister, meanwhile, sent Kaye and Kathy $50. According to Acker, her Nana disdained regular clothing stores because \"other humans shopped in them,\" and she had her own dressmaker. That Christmas was important at all suggests how little emphasis the family placed on its Jewishness. Acker would later say that she was \"glad\" to be Jewish\u2014\"I think we're intellectual, tough, funny,\" she told an interviewer, adding that she liked \"the wandering business, not being nationalistic.\" But Acker's mother, Claire, did her best to downplay their faith; while she would be involved in various Jewish causes and organizations, according to Acker and other friends, Claire would have much preferred to be a blue-blooded WASP and acted accordingly\u2014both the school and the summer camp that Acker attended as a girl were largely devoid of Jews. Claire was born to Florrie and Albert on June 7, 1925. She was their only child and, Kaye remembered, adored and spoiled. At the same time, she seemed to live forever in Florrie's shadow, perpetually reliant on her mother's largesse and fearful of her wrath. Acker recounted one childhood memory of looking through drawers in her parents' closet. There she found a soft gray hat that she promptly put on her head. When Claire saw it, she snatched it away and slapped her daughter across the face. She told Kathy that it was her father's old hat and that Kathy was never to touch it again. Albert, Claire went on, was \"the kindest man who ever lived,\" and Florrie the opposite. \"You know what she's like,\" Claire said. \"She still tells me what to do. You saw what happened with that dress I bought at the beginning of this week. She saw it on me and didn't like it. I had to take it back to the store. I'm 37 years old.\" In a prose poem that was part of Acker's first self-published chapbook, Politics, she claims that Claire inherited $250,000 from her father, but that she gave the money back to Florrie so \"that her mother would still support her.\" As an adult, Claire was physically beautiful: petite, with dark hair she kept short as she aged, and bewitching emerald eyes. Constantly conscious of her weight, she took \"diet pills\"\u2014amphetamines\u2014to keep it down. Her moods were unpredictable (the speed didn't help), and she could be narcissistic, arbitrarily cruel, extremely strict. She was intelligent but inhibited by the culture and the time period\u2014she received no postsecondary education, became a mother at a young age, and never held a paying job. She did volunteer at the Jewish Guild for the Blind, typing books into Braille, as well as at an organization for \"unwed mothers,\" according to her daughter and Acker's half sister Wendy Bowers, taking the young women to doctors' appointments. She shopped often and played mahjong once a week with the same group of women. Over the years, she had many dogs, always poodles, that she doted on. She usually dressed, Acker wrote, like a fifties \"dowager,\" even into the seventies: tight cashmere sweater skirts hemmed at the knee, stockings, high black heels, small Gucci purse, bright red lipstick. \"She seemed bright, probably underchallenged in her life,\" said Peter Gordon, Acker's second husband. \"She sort of had a little edge to her and a twinkle.\" Others recalled her a bit less kindly: \"I remember Claire on one of the very few occasions that I was invited to their apartment as being detached and aloof,\" Kaye said, \"more concerned about an upcoming session with her manicurist than being a good hostess.\" Bowers felt she was, on the whole, extremely conservative and saw everything as \"black-and-white.\" In the story that Acker would tell over and over in her books, and with only slight variation, Claire became seriously ill when she was twenty-one or twenty-two years old. A doctor told her that getting pregnant would somehow cure her. Claire did get pregnant, but the illness persisted. She wanted an abortion but was too frightened to get one. After Kathy was born, Claire was properly diagnosed with appendicitis. But before that, the man who had impregnated her had left both of them. \"Let me tell you what is was like in that womb,\" Acker wrote in one of her last notebooks. \"After my father walked out. Absence isn't absent; it's pain.\" Acker's relationship with her mother would become extremely complicated, to say the least, but in these final notebook entries, she makes clear, yet again, how deeply she identified with Claire:\n                She was raw, a kid, with all the faults of a kid so now all she felt was rage, unadulterated fury. She would kill. She would kill that baby in the womb. She knew why he was leaving her\u2014it was that kid in my womb\u2014she had never wanted one anyway\u2014the doc, he was a quack, he must be a quack, told her that if she got pregnant she wouldn't have this pain in her abdomen\u2014she hated pain because she was a beautiful kid. What did she want with a brat since she was a brat? Get out of here. Get rid of it. Get rid of him too; he was walking out on her; she loved and adored him so much she would never love again. This pain was retrospective, however\u2014Kathy wouldn't discover this abandonment, or the name of her birth father, until she was a teenager. For the first few years of her childhood, she had no reason to think that the man who called himself her father and whose name was printed on her birth certificate was not her actual parent. Albert Alexander was known as Bud (perhaps to distinguish him from Claire's father and grandfather, all of whom shared the same name). His early adulthood was eventful if somewhat wayward: he dropped out of college at nineteen to run a clothing store; married, had a son, and then promptly divorced; was drafted into the army in July 1943, and spent the remaining years of World War II in the service. Nobody recalled how and where he might have met Claire, but when they did meet, she was three or four months pregnant with Kathy. They married soon after, and when Kathy was born, he raised her as his own daughter. Bud was thin, short, balding. After her father's death, Florrie had taken over the glove company, and Bud worked for her there as administrator, seemingly continuing to do so even after the company was later sold. He made a good salary, Bowers remembered. Acker characterized him often in her fiction as a dissolute alcoholic, though Bowers recalled his drinking as no worse than the average consumption of the era\u2014a beer or two every night when he came home from work. Robert Acker, Acker's first husband, described him as a \"cipher,\" and indeed, his presence within the family, in the world, was almost imperceptible. \"He went to work every day,\" Bowers said. \"Did his job. On Sundays, we'd go to Rockefeller Center and go ice skating. Other than that, I mean, he was there. Was he a great father? No.\" Within Pooh Kaye's family, Bud's mild-manned remove registered as something worse. They considered him a playboy, ineffectual and lazy, undeniably reliant on his wife's money. \"My father had huge contempt for Kathy's father. The family was not too fond of him.\" Kaye claimed. In her writing, Acker is similarly scornful; the lightly fictionalized Bud character found in her books is consistently characterized as stupid, dull, his gentleness more a sign of weakness than virtue. His greatest sin is his indifference to art and literature. He also, it seemed, wished that Acker was a boy, and sometimes treated her that way. When she was born, Acker was named Karen, after Bud's sister. But Claire apparently despised the woman, and refused to call her daughter by that name, preferring, instead the nickname Kathy. \"Karen\" was so rarely used outside of official channels, in fact, that Bowers claimed to have never heard it. \"She gave me this name she hated,\" Acker wrote of her mother. \"Only when very drunk do I mention that name.\" From the very beginning, then, Kathy's identity was literally up for grabs, and the process of naming, and the interpellation of women, would become a subject at the heart of her fiction. \"As a girl,\" Acker would later write, \"I was outside the world. I wasn't. I had no name.\" A name, she learned, could be both a privilege and a prison.",
        "chat-gpt": "Kathy Acker, originally named Karen Alexander, was born in Manhattan at 7:05 a.m. on April 18, 1947. Her birth was marked by difficulties, as she was born premature, underweight, and considered unattractive. Her maternal grandmother, Florence, married Albert Weill, a businessman who owned a glove manufacturing business in Manhattan. The family had experienced affluence but faced financial setbacks due to the stock market crash in 1929. Kathy's mother, Claire, was born to Florrie and Albert on June 7, 1925. Claire adored and spoiled, but she lived in her mother's shadow and relied on her mother's support. Claire was physically beautiful, constantly conscious of her weight, and could be unpredictable in her moods. Claire attempted to downplay their Jewish faith, preferring to be a blue-blooded WASP. Her relationship with her daughter, Kathy, was complicated, and Kathy identified deeply with her. Claire became seriously ill when she was in her early twenties and was advised to get pregnant as a potential cure. She did get pregnant with Kathy but remained ill. Her pregnancy with Kathy, who would become Acker, complicated the already strained relationship with the man who impregnated her, and he left them. Kathy's father, Bud, raised her as his own daughter, despite her not being biologically his. He worked for Florrie's glove company and was characterized differently in Acker's fiction. Bud was described as a quiet and somewhat indifferent figure within the family, with Acker often portraying him negatively in her writing. Kathy's original name, Karen, was rarely used due to her mother's strong preference for the name Kathy. Her mother's disregard for her original name, Karen, had a significant influence on Kathy's sense of identity and became a central theme in her writing. Kathy would later reflect on her childhood as a time when she felt \"outside the world\" and without a name, highlighting the complex relationship between privilege and constraint associated with one's name."

        "original":"UNTIL SHE LEFT NEW YORK for college in 1964, Kathy only ever lived in one place, on the sixth floor of a nineteen-story, prewar building at 400 East 57th Street, at First Avenue. The building was located at the edge of Sutton Place, a highly affluent enclave just blocks from midtown and home, over the years, to such celebrities as Henry Kissinger, I. M. Pei, and Bill Blass. In 1956, Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe were the Alexanders' neighbors, occupying a penthouse apartment at 444 East 57th. Kathy's home, however, was somewhat more Sutton Place adjacent\u2014rent-controlled, relatively modest, on the small side. It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a sunken living room, a tiny kitchen. After Wendy was born, on July 1, 1949, the two girls shared a room, and would do so throughout their childhood and adolescence, a fact that forever vexed Kathy (she was still complaining about it with her psychic when she was in her late forties). In Requiem, one of her last works, Acker described the apartment thusly:\n            A small apartment\u2014its interior reveals that its inhabitants aren't all that wealthy. A narrow, dark green hall leads, on one side, to a large sunken living room, the largest room in the apartment. All the sofas and chairs in this room, of which there are many, have silk exteriors; the clear plastic that Claire explains are [sic] needed to protect the pale silks from stains are never taken off except when there are guests. There are a number of antiques including a captain's desk in which there are hiding places, a table whose inlaid pads are the color of ivy. A cabinet replete with china dogs supervises the large writing desk, of the same wood, beneath it. No one ever uses this desk. Acker also recalled that she wasn't permitted to put up any pictures or photographs on the walls of her room, and that Claire, despite spending lots of money on her own clothes and furnishings, never changed the rose-patterned drapes or the green paint on the walls of her daughters' room. Even as they grew into teenagers, Kathy and Wendy still had the same single beds they slept in as children. Kathy's refuge, as a young child, was the tiny park at the end of the street, beside the East River, where she sometimes went to play with her mother. For Kathy, the park offered possibility and solitude, as well as access to the natural world (as domesticated as it was), the sea, even other lands. In Great Expectations, this park is the site of a rare, enchanted, but ultimately fleeting, Christmas moment she shares with Claire: \"I stay in this magic snow with the beautiful yellow sun beating down on me as long as I can until a voice in my head (me) or my mother says, 'Now you know what this experience is, you have to leave.'\" In all of her books, Acker describes the family home as a \"prison,\" though, in many ways, it was far more ordinary and comfortable than that. Indeed, the outward conventionality of Acker's early childhood offers no hint of her future restlessness or iconoclasm. Bowers recalled that the family ate dinner together every night, then the girls would do their homework. Afterward, they would all retreat to Claire and Bud's bedroom, where they kept their only TV, and the family would gather on the bed and watch together. As she got older, Kathy rarely participated in this ritual, preferring to read alone in her room. The poodles were an ever-present feature of the apartment, both amusement and annoyance. Wendy and Kathy got along reasonably well, though even then they were clearly different\u2014the former more athletic and less bookish. Both girls were extremely sheltered. Their early lives were a small, closed circuit: school, home, school, home. If they went anywhere else\u2014to Broadway shows, Rockefeller Center, to the park at the end of the street\u2014it was always with their parents or grandmother. Among the many objects that Acker possessed at her death was an album of family photographs. It was large and pumpkin orange, its plastic cover smudged and tacky from decades of handling. Inside, glued to pages of faded, occasionally torn scrapbook paper, were just over a hundred black-and-white photographs of Kathy, Wendy, and other family members, some identified, some not. Here was baby Kathy at six weeks, held by Claire; a two-year-old Kathy, in Bud's arms, outside a Gristedes supermarket. In a photo taken in Westport, Connecticut, Kathy and Wendy pose in the grass with a nameless spaniel and their grandmother's African-American housekeeper, Grace Brown, who often served as their nanny. Aside from a photograph of Kathy talking on the phone, in which she looks to be about twelve, all of the pictures in the album are of her as an infant or young child. \"I tried to run away from the pain named childhood,\" Acker writes in My Mother: Demonology, \"like you flush a huge shit down the toilet. I've been running ever since.\" But here, in these photographs at least, there's little evidence of this pain. There is, in fact, only its opposite: a smiling, tiny Kathy, perched on a pony, or beaming beside a Christmas tree, seemingly cherished by everyone around her. She looks like a sweet child, with plump lips and dark, expressive eyes. She doesn't seem to mind the camera, and in most of these pictures, smiles broadly (and much more frequently than Wendy, at least). Of course, a single family photo album is a small, overdetermined, and unrepresentative sample. It shows little, proves nothing. But it was apparently the only trace of her family that Acker held on to throughout her adult life, and it remains the only real record of Acker's youth. It's easy to imagine Acker coming back again and again to these images as inspirational prods for her writing. Or perhaps simply to return to a bygone, relatively innocent time, reminding Acker of what she was like before the abandonment and death that would shadow her later years. Many of the photographs show the girls at the beach. When Kathy was seven or eight, Florrie bought a summer home in Atlantic Beach, on the South Shore of Long Island. Thereafter, the family vacationed there every year, driving out as soon as school ended. Bud would still work in the city and would commute by train at the end of the day. The house was a block from the beach, and for some reason, Florrie was a member of one beach club, and Bud and Claire a different one. In any case, until they went to camp in Maine in their early adolescence, Kathy and Wendy spent every summer day at the ocean. By all accounts, Kathy was always much closer to her Nana than to anyone else in the family. Where Claire seemed weak and dependent, Florrie was a confident, self-reliant survivor. \"She saw Florrie as a tower of strength,\" Pooh Kaye said, \"and someone who got her way.\" Kathy craved Florrie's admiration and respect, things that Claire also presumably desired but never seemed to receive. Florrie was more cultured than Claire as well\u2014she was the one who took Kathy and Wendy to galleries and museums. When Acker first began to self-publish, she sent her chapbooks to Florrie, and, according to Kaye, her grandmother was \"full of praise, much to Kathy's surprise and complete delight.\" Bowers concurred with this: \"She understood what she was trying to accomplish with her writing. I think my grandmother understood Kathy better than my mother did.\" In Acker's writing, Claire is villain and victim at once, and above all, a black hole\u2014all-consuming, unknowable. \"I'm probably concerned with my mother in my texts,\" Acker wrote in an essay late in life. \"I'm concerned with the father and my mother.\" The French feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray gave Acker some theoretical ballast here, arguing that, in a patriarchal culture, women are compelled to have a doubled, ambiguous relationship with their mothers: \"On the one hand, my mother was or is my lover,\" Acker wrote. \"On the other hand, my mother was a victim in the male-defined society. So, if I identify with her, I'm forced to define myself as a victim. So how do I deal with this double bind? Go mad? (Pun intended.) Irigaray says we, females, have to reinstate the mother as another person. I take that rather seriously.\" It's frustrating therefore to have so little firsthand evidence of Claire's life and personality, other than, of course, Acker's words themselves. As the architect of her own myth, Acker was fortunate to have a family that did not keep records.I Outside of those published words, however, are the many notebooks and letters in which Acker worked out her fiction, drafted and rehearsed it, and the details within those pages are specific and consistent enough to constitute a portrait of some verifiable fidelity. \"Most of it is true,\" Wendy Bowers averred, when asked of the novels' accuracy. Bowers felt that she and Kathy had a happy early childhood, though Bowers also describes Claire as a \"very strict\" woman who completely controlled their young lives. \"I think we agreed about a lot of things about our mother, but I was able to accept who she was,\" Bowers said. \"I think my sister had a hard time with it.\" Indeed, the Claire that haunts Acker's writing is a complex and enigmatic figure, a mother both remote and authoritarian, malevolent and pathetic. From the beginning, when she gives Kathy a name that she hates, Claire makes her child an object of derision. She rarely expresses love or affection, never gives Kathy gifts, even at Christmas. When Kathy is very young, she has a beloved pink blanket, covered in appliqu\u00e9d roses; at some point, Claire takes it away to get cleaned and then never bothers to return it. She is also capable of physical cruelty; a story Acker told several people, and repeated in her writing, was that, on at least one occasion, Claire ambushed Kathy in the shower and threw a glass of cold water on her, apparently hoping that her daughter would slip and fall. In another, darker version of the story, Claire tried to drown her. All of these injustices, from the minor to the grave, deeply marked Acker. She tallied all the above in one of the notebooks she kept for her novel My Mother: Demonology, summing them up thusly: \"These are all the accounts of how my mother tried to kill me.\" Above all, in Acker's mind, Claire hated Kathy because Kathy ruined her life. By getting pregnant, Claire lost Kathy's father and was forced to settle for a marriage to a man she didn't really love, to sacrifice herself to a life of compromise and dissatisfaction. \"She tells him that he's worthless,\" she writes of Bud and Claire's marriage in Requiem. \"He has a job only because he married into the family, all the wealth is on her side of the family. He tells her that he bought her her first mink coat. They go through this every single day.\" For Kathy, Claire never fulfilled her potential, whatever that potential may have been. She was a quintessential 1950s American housewife, a dumb stereotype slowly wasting her life, ultimately consumed by her own dissatisfaction. Her most important role, then, for Kathy, was to serve as a negative example. Kathy looked at Claire and determined that she would live as differently as possible. She would lead a purposeful, creative, self-directed life. She would never let anyone tell her what to do. \"I have no sense of a person,\" Acker wrote of Claire, \"I have a sense of my mother. My mother was a person; she stopped me from doing what I wanted to do. I wanted to get away from her.\" And Acker would not place anyone's needs above her own. For the rest of her life, she would never really take responsibility for anyone other than herself. I. Pooh Kaye recalled that her own unstable mother cleaned out a trunk full of family letters and documents, including several letters from Acker to Kaye's father, Clifford, and replaced them, bizarrely, with McDonald's hamburger wrappers.",
        "chat-gpt": "Kathy Acker's early life in New York was spent at 400 East 57th Street, on the sixth floor of a prewar building. This building was located on the edge of Sutton Place, a wealthy neighborhood near midtown Manhattan, home to notable figures like Henry Kissinger, I. M. Pei, and Bill Blass. Acker's family occupied a relatively modest, rent-controlled apartment with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a sunken living room, and a small kitchen. Kathy and her younger sister, Wendy, shared a room, a source of ongoing frustration for Kathy. Acker described their apartment in her work \"Requiem,\" mentioning silk-covered furniture and antiques. Despite being surrounded by fine possessions, Claire, their mother, maintained strict control over their environment, including the restriction of decorations in the girls' room. Kathy found solace in a small park near the East River, where she played with her mother. This park offered her a sense of possibility, solitude, and a connection to the natural world. Acker often referred to her family home as a \"prison\" in her writings, although their family life was more ordinary and comfortable than this term suggests. The family had dinner together each night, followed by homework, and then gathered in Claire and Bud's bedroom to watch TV. Kathy, as she grew older, often preferred to read alone in her room. The family had poodles, and Kathy and Wendy, while different in character, got along reasonably well. Their lives were sheltered, and they primarily interacted with family members. Kathy held a close bond with her grandmother, Florrie, who was more confident and cultured than her mother, Claire. Claire remains an enigmatic figure in Acker's writings, depicted as both authoritarian and malevolent, marked by a lack of affection, gifts, and cruel acts, ranging from taking away Kathy's cherished blanket to more severe physical mistreatment. Acker believed that Claire resented her for her role in \"ruining\" her life by getting pregnant. According to Acker, Claire's life was one of compromise and dissatisfaction, and she viewed her mother as an example of what not to be. Kathy vowed to lead a creative, self-directed life and never let anyone dictate her choices. Claire's actions and her own determination pushed Kathy to prioritize her own needs and independence. While there is a lack of firsthand evidence of Claire's life, Acker's writings, notebooks, and letters provide insights into her complex relationship with her mother. Claire played a central role in shaping Acker's outlook on life, inspiring her to pursue a different path and avoid sacrificing her own desires for the sake of others. This decision to break free from conventional expectations remained with Acker throughout her life."

        "original":"THE POSTWAR AMERICA THAT KATHY grew up in was one of unprecedented prosperity and stability. The population boomed, government spending boomed, and there was a sense that the country was, or would soon become, almost entirely middle-class, both in terms of its values and its economy. While capitalism seemed to have triumphed, and consumerism was in ascendance, full employment and poverty relief were undeniably still goals, taxes were high, and the country was still a limited welfare state. Benefitting immensely from the countless European scientists, artists, and intellectuals who had found refuge in the United States, however, and with its industrial infrastructure intact and thriving, the country dominated global affairs. With many great European cities still in ruin, New York City reasserted itself as a global capital of commerce, art, and politics. A sense of conciliation and consensus prevailed. At the same time, the U.S. simmered with anxiety\u2014over Communism and its spread both internationally and within the country's borders; over the creeping corporatization of life and politics; over evolving ideas around race, family, and gender. Millions of women had entered the workforce during World War II, and while many returned to life as mothers and homemakers, the sense of expanded possibility led directly to the emergence of women's liberation the following decade. The development of the birth control pill, which began in 1950, further amplified this shift. While mainstream society extolled bureaucracy, conformity, and unity, a fledgling counterculture was taking shape in opposition to these values. The best-known representatives of this so-called Beat Generation were its literary stars\u2014Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs\u2014who first congregated at Columbia University and in Greenwich Village. From the outset, Kathy was trained to do much more than keep house or raise children. In 1952, when she was five years old, she started at the Lenox School, an all-girls prep school located at 170 East 70th Street. The suffragette and educator Jessica Garretson Finch founded Lenox in 1916. A Barnard graduate who felt that her education had left her with no practical skills, Finch had previously started the Finch School (later Finch College) as a secondary school to prepare women for the working world; Lenox was, in turn, created to prepare girls for Finch. Lenox's four-story Renaissance Revival limestone building was built as a carriage house and horse stable in 1902 and purchased by Lenox in 1925.I By the standards of mid-century New York private schools, Lenox wasn't considered the finest education available, but it was unquestionably top-notch. Its head of school, Cecily Selby, was a renowned scientist with a degree in physics from Radcliffe and a doctorate in physical biology from MIT, and was working to make Lenox even more academically rigorous. Classes were small and intimate, and the teachers could be compelling, the curriculum strictly defined but ambitious. In grade seven, British history was mandatory; in grade eight, American. Students had to learn two additional languages, French and Latin. The school could be claustrophobic and regimented\u2014classes of twenty were divided into two sections, \"the smart and the not-smart,\" according to Linda Muller Vasu, one of Kathy's classmates\u2014but there was also often, Vasu said, a pervasive atmosphere of joy in its halls. Kathy was, apparently, a sterling student from the beginning: bright and bookish and hardworking. The cloistered, circumscribed life that she continued to lead\u2014it was still just school, home, Long Island\u2014might have been constricting, but it hadn't occurred to her yet to resist it. It's possible Kathy started writing during those earliest grades\u2014she later claimed that she won a poetry contest in the sixth grade\u2014but it's more likely her serious writing efforts didn't begin until high school, where she did, in fact, win a writing contest or two. Kathy's classmates were awash in money and privilege. By the time she got to high school, her classmates included Faith Golding, a real estate heiress whose father owned Essex House on Central Park and controlled the Sterling National Bank, and who, at eighteen, married twenty-two-year-old Ron Perelman, later one of Wall Street's most notorious corporate raiders and New York's richest man; Sherry Frawley, whose father was the proprietor of Pete's Tavern, the renowned Gramercy Park pub; and Betsy Kimmelman, daughter of hotelier Milton Kimmelman, who owned the Sherry-Netherland, the Ambassador, and the Barbizon, among many others. These were teenagers with their own chauffeurs and apartments. She and Wendy, on the other hand, took the bus to school. \"I was born a rich kid,\" Acker would later tell an interviewer, but at Lenox she learned that there were kids born much wealthier and more advantaged than she. In \"The Invisible Universe,\" an essay Acker published in 1982, she asks how a great writer comes into being. Her answer was characteristically overwrought, remarkable, and oblique, but in its run-on pileup of adjectives and nouns as revealing a self-portrait as any other she composed: \"Hatred antipathy to human fear of everything selfishness inability to communicate deformed physical attributes chronic illnesses moods-like-demons in particular: epileptic escapism, thundering na\u00efve desires?\" Books were a place for Kathy to engage that escapism, to satisfy her thundering na\u00efve desires. She started reading at an early age, and found in literature not just a place to escape but a place for everything. Books were the most romantic, even sacred, of objects; they were time machines, genie lamps, merit badges, force fields. They provided insulation from the actual life she led, and opened up the possibility of other, more captivating lives; she could, literally, lose herself in books. \"When I was a kid I always thought of books as more real than anything else,\" she told an interviewer. \"I had a bad childhood and books really were my reality.\" To write books, then, to become a writer herself, was to create her own reality. She could summon love, exorcise hatred, and ultimately exact revenge on those who had rejected or hurt her. She was a precocious reader too. While Claire read a fair bit also, mostly murder mysteries, Kathy told Wendy early in their youth that she was going to read \"every single classic.\" At Lenox, her classmates recalled, she proudly carried around Modern Library editions of those classics, their covers always faced outward to advertise their contents. The first adult authors she read were Dickens, Blake, and Hawthorne. As this peacocking suggests, Kathy was competitive too, and books and writing were her preferred arena. \"Books are the only people who like me,\" she wrote, half-jokingly, a decade later. This wasn't quite true of her in high school. Kathy had her fair share of friends there, and teachers who openly adored her. But nevertheless, just as at home, she felt apart, different, lonely. If she was not exactly an outcast, to a large extent she considered herself an outsider. She tended to lean into this difference and strangeness, but in truth, she occupied a more in-between position, one she found herself in throughout much of her life, in fact\u2014at once inside and outside, alienated and reconciled, blessed and cursed. In grade seven, she met twin sisters Linda and Susan Muller,II who would become both good friends and fierce rivals. The Mullers were outsiders of a sort too. Though well-off, their parents were divorced, an anomaly at the time; the girls lived on Park Avenue with their mother. Kathy and the Mullers were all in the \"smart\" section of their grade, and would meet for study dates or talk about their homework over the phone. Linda recalled that their conversations were largely a blur of checking in and one-upmanship, particularly once they all got to high school. \"Have you read this, have you done the math, what's your science project, what do you think about Gogol's The Overcoat?\" They sometimes played bridge at the Mullers' apartment, staying up until two or three in the morning, then heading to Reuben's, a twenty-four-hour deli, for a late-night, early morning breakfast. Linda remembered Kathy always wanting to be a writer, nothing else, and that she kept a commonplace book in which to chronicle her reading. But the Kathy she recalled was also an unabashed free spirit, physically unkempt and emotionally volatile. The Mullers were identical twins, and tall, blonde, and beautiful. Teenaged Kathy, in contrast, was small and somewhat gawky, with a mouth too big for her body, an effect she enhanced by not washing or combing her hair and often showing up to school in a grubby uniform. In retrospect, this seems like a deliberate, easy expression of defiance; it reinforced her sense of difference, her disregard for conventional behavior and appearance. To Linda, it suggested something more, that Kathy was virtually feral, basically unparented. \"She never cared about how she looked,\" Linda said. \"And most adolescents do. She was smelly. She was not particularly attractive. Nor was she friendly. She had the sorts of traits and values and mindset of a motherless female.\" In the classroom too, she was blithe about following rules, speaking without raising her hand, assertive and confrontational. Miraculously, her teachers usually tolerated such behavior; all was forgiven because of Kathy's academic brilliance and boundless curiosity. Linda found Kathy refreshingly authentic, particularly for a teenager, but she was also somewhat afraid of and for her. This feeling became more acute when Kathy began to have sex, the first girl, Linda remembered, in their class to do so. \"This was a huge thing in a girls' school,\" Linda said, \"and she defined herself early on in that way.\" By the ninth grade, the three girls were going to weekend parties, and Linda recalled Kathy drinking and then disappearing with whatever boy took an interest in her. Kathy would later brag about these exploits, but Linda was alarmed by Kathy's abandon and apparent heedlessness. \"She was sort of self-destructive,\" Linda said. I. Lenox itself merged with Birch Wathen in 1989 and is now the Birch Wathen Lenox School; the building became the home of the New York School of Design in 1993. II. In another instance of Acker's poor spelling or faulty memory, she typically misspells Muller as Mueller in her books.",

            "fulltext": "Kathy Acker's upbringing took place in postwar America, marked by unprecedented prosperity and stability. The United States was experiencing significant economic growth and growing affluence, while the country dominated global affairs due to the influx of European scientists, artists, and intellectuals who had sought refuge there. New York City, in particular, emerged as a global hub for commerce, art, and politics. Kathy's educational journey began in 1952 when she started attending the Lenox School, an all-girls prep school founded by suffragette and educator Jessica Garretson Finch. While not considered the finest among New York's private schools, Lenox offered top-notch education. The school's head, Cecily Selby, was a renowned scientist, making efforts to enhance its academic rigor. Kathy was an exceptional student, demonstrating intelligence, a love for books, and a strong work ethic. She received education in small, intimate classes, studying subjects like British and American history, French, and Latin. Her classmates were affluent, coming from wealthy families with their own chauffeurs and apartments. Kathy, along with her sister Wendy, took the bus to school, realizing that there were kids even wealthier than she. Acker's passion for reading began at an early age, and books served as an escape from her challenging life. To her, books were a source of solace and an opportunity to lose herself in different worlds. As she ventured into high school, Kathy continued to read avidly, carrying Modern Library editions of classics. She was competitive and took pride in showcasing her literary prowess. High school also marked the beginning of her serious writing efforts. She read authors like Dickens, Blake, and Hawthorne. Despite having friends and teachers who admired her, she often felt like an outsider, leaning into her distinctiveness. In grade seven, she met twin sisters, Linda and Susan Muller, who became both friends and rivals. Linda recalled Kathy as a free spirit, unkempt, emotionally volatile, and uninterested in her appearance. In class, Kathy often flouted rules and displayed assertiveness and confrontational behavior. Kathy's academic brilliance and boundless curiosity usually made her teachers tolerate her unconventional behavior. However, her fearlessness extended beyond the classroom, and she began engaging in sexual relationships earlier than her peers, which was particularly remarkable in a girls' school like Lenox. By the ninth grade, Kathy started attending weekend parties, indulging in drinking and pursuing romantic encounters with boys. Linda saw her as authentic yet self-destructive, raising concerns about her well-being. Kathy's exploration of her sexuality and her unapologetic self-expression were defining aspects of her teenage years.",
