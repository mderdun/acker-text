  "1": "She was born Karen Alexander in Manhattan at 7:05 a.m. on April 18, 1947. From the outset, at least according to Acker, things were difficult\u2014she was born premature, underweight, ugly. But, as in a fairy tale, her difficulties, her pain, began long before her birth. Acker's grandmother's family, on her mother's side, were the Greenfields, who arrived in New York from Austria in the 1870s or 1880s, and owned a butcher shop on York Avenue on the Upper East Side. Her grandmother, Florence (known as Florrie to friends and family, Nana to her grandchildren) was the oldest of three daughters, born on July 4, 1883. She married Albert Weill, a businessman who owned a glove manufacturing business in Manhattan. Acker's cousin, Pooh Kaye, believed that the family was affluent, upwardly mobile, bourgeois, and ambitious. But like many, they saw their wealth plummet when the stock market crashed in 1929. \"We were the grandchildren of nouveau riche immigrants who lost most of their investments during the Depression,\" she said. Little else is known about the family's early years, and in Acker's own writing\u2014a comprehensive but not always reliable record\u2014some of those details are misremembered or obscured. In an early draft of her novel Don Quixote, Acker writes:\n                My father's and my mother's family're both from Alsace-Lorraine and Jewish. I know nothing else about my father's family. My mother's mother, her two sisters, and her mother and father came over to America when my grandmother was young, in about 1900. Though rich in the old country, they couldn't bring their wealth to America. (Am I making up these details?) I don't know why. Nana (my grandmother) must have detested being poor because in her late adolescence, she told me she's now inordinately (that's my word: hers is very) proud of having started a successful millinery shop. The millinery shop was in Brooklyn. Being in the shop introduced her, when she was 30 years old, to her first and only husband. (These dates don't match.) \"I waited until I found the right man.\" The right man ran the American ladies' glove business. According to Acker, Albert Weill died in 1950, and Florrie never remarried. But she was, and remained, a force: statuesque, commanding, intimidating. She was financially canny, a regular player of the stock market, but could also be miserly. When she was a child, Kaye said, Florrie would send her and her brothers just a single dollar bill for Christmas (a gift that later became $5, plus a box of Kathy's expensive hand-me-downs). Florrie's younger sister, meanwhile, sent Kaye and Kathy $50. According to Acker, her Nana disdained regular clothing stores because \"other humans shopped in them,\" and she had her own dressmaker. That Christmas was important at all suggests how little emphasis the family placed on its Jewishness. Acker would later say that she was \"glad\" to be Jewish\u2014\"I think we're intellectual, tough, funny,\" she told an interviewer, adding that she liked \"the wandering business, not being nationalistic.\" But Acker's mother, Claire, did her best to downplay their faith; while she would be involved in various Jewish causes and organizations, according to Acker and other friends, Claire would have much preferred to be a blue-blooded WASP and acted accordingly\u2014both the school and the summer camp that Acker attended as a girl were largely devoid of Jews. Claire was born to Florrie and Albert on June 7, 1925. She was their only child and, Kaye remembered, adored and spoiled. At the same time, she seemed to live forever in Florrie's shadow, perpetually reliant on her mother's largesse and fearful of her wrath. Acker recounted one childhood memory of looking through drawers in her parents' closet. There she found a soft gray hat that she promptly put on her head. When Claire saw it, she snatched it away and slapped her daughter across the face. She told Kathy that it was her father's old hat and that Kathy was never to touch it again. Albert, Claire went on, was \"the kindest man who ever lived,\" and Florrie the opposite. \"You know what she's like,\" Claire said. \"She still tells me what to do. You saw what happened with that dress I bought at the beginning of this week. She saw it on me and didn't like it. I had to take it back to the store. I'm 37 years old.\" In a prose poem that was part of Acker's first self-published chapbook, Politics, she claims that Claire inherited $250,000 from her father, but that she gave the money back to Florrie so \"that her mother would still support her.\" As an adult, Claire was physically beautiful: petite, with dark hair she kept short as she aged, and bewitching emerald eyes. Constantly conscious of her weight, she took \"diet pills\"\u2014amphetamines\u2014to keep it down. Her moods were unpredictable (the speed didn't help), and she could be narcissistic, arbitrarily cruel, extremely strict. She was intelligent but inhibited by the culture and the time period\u2014she received no postsecondary education, became a mother at a young age, and never held a paying job. She did volunteer at the Jewish Guild for the Blind, typing books into Braille, as well as at an organization for \"unwed mothers,\" according to her daughter and Acker's half sister Wendy Bowers, taking the young women to doctors' appointments. She shopped often and played mahjong once a week with the same group of women. Over the years, she had many dogs, always poodles, that she doted on. She usually dressed, Acker wrote, like a fifties \"dowager,\" even into the seventies: tight cashmere sweater skirts hemmed at the knee, stockings, high black heels, small Gucci purse, bright red lipstick. \"She seemed bright, probably underchallenged in her life,\" said Peter Gordon, Acker's second husband. \"She sort of had a little edge to her and a twinkle.\" Others recalled her a bit less kindly: \"I remember Claire on one of the very few occasions that I was invited to their apartment as being detached and aloof,\" Kaye said, \"more concerned about an upcoming session with her manicurist than being a good hostess.\" Bowers felt she was, on the whole, extremely conservative and saw everything as \"black-and-white.\" In the story that Acker would tell over and over in her books, and with only slight variation, Claire became seriously ill when she was twenty-one or twenty-two years old. A doctor told her that getting pregnant would somehow cure her. Claire did get pregnant, but the illness persisted. She wanted an abortion but was too frightened to get one. After Kathy was born, Claire was properly diagnosed with appendicitis. But before that, the man who had impregnated her had left both of them. \"Let me tell you what is was like in that womb,\" Acker wrote in one of her last notebooks. \"After my father walked out. Absence isn't absent; it's pain.\" Acker's relationship with her mother would become extremely complicated, to say the least, but in these final notebook entries, she makes clear, yet again, how deeply she identified with Claire:\n                She was raw, a kid, with all the faults of a kid so now all she felt was rage, unadulterated fury. She would kill. She would kill that baby in the womb. She knew why he was leaving her\u2014it was that kid in my womb\u2014she had never wanted one anyway\u2014the doc, he was a quack, he must be a quack, told her that if she got pregnant she wouldn't have this pain in her abdomen\u2014she hated pain because she was a beautiful kid. What did she want with a brat since she was a brat? Get out of here. Get rid of it. Get rid of him too; he was walking out on her; she loved and adored him so much she would never love again. This pain was retrospective, however\u2014Kathy wouldn't discover this abandonment, or the name of her birth father, until she was a teenager. For the first few years of her childhood, she had no reason to think that the man who called himself her father and whose name was printed on her birth certificate was not her actual parent. Albert Alexander was known as Bud (perhaps to distinguish him from Claire's father and grandfather, all of whom shared the same name). His early adulthood was eventful if somewhat wayward: he dropped out of college at nineteen to run a clothing store; married, had a son, and then promptly divorced; was drafted into the army in July 1943, and spent the remaining years of World War II in the service. Nobody recalled how and where he might have met Claire, but when they did meet, she was three or four months pregnant with Kathy. They married soon after, and when Kathy was born, he raised her as his own daughter. Bud was thin, short, balding. After her father's death, Florrie had taken over the glove company, and Bud worked for her there as administrator, seemingly continuing to do so even after the company was later sold. He made a good salary, Bowers remembered. Acker characterized him often in her fiction as a dissolute alcoholic, though Bowers recalled his drinking as no worse than the average consumption of the era\u2014a beer or two every night when he came home from work. Robert Acker, Acker's first husband, described him as a \"cipher,\" and indeed, his presence within the family, in the world, was almost imperceptible. \"He went to work every day,\" Bowers said. \"Did his job. On Sundays, we'd go to Rockefeller Center and go ice skating. Other than that, I mean, he was there. Was he a great father? No.\" Within Pooh Kaye's family, Bud's mild-manned remove registered as something worse. They considered him a playboy, ineffectual and lazy, undeniably reliant on his wife's money. \"My father had huge contempt for Kathy's father. The family was not too fond of him.\" Kaye claimed. In her writing, Acker is similarly scornful; the lightly fictionalized Bud character found in her books is consistently characterized as stupid, dull, his gentleness more a sign of weakness than virtue. His greatest sin is his indifference to art and literature. He also, it seemed, wished that Acker was a boy, and sometimes treated her that way. When she was born, Acker was named Karen, after Bud's sister. But Claire apparently despised the woman, and refused to call her daughter by that name, preferring, instead the nickname Kathy. \"Karen\" was so rarely used outside of official channels, in fact, that Bowers claimed to have never heard it. \"She gave me this name she hated,\" Acker wrote of her mother. \"Only when very drunk do I mention that name.\" From the very beginning, then, Kathy's identity was literally up for grabs, and the process of naming, and the interpellation of women, would become a subject at the heart of her fiction. \"As a girl,\" Acker would later write, \"I was outside the world. I wasn't. I had no name.\" A name, she learned, could be both a privilege and a prison. ",
  "2": "UNTIL SHE LEFT NEW YORK for college in 1964, Kathy only ever lived in one place, on the sixth floor of a nineteen-story, prewar building at 400 East 57th Street, at First Avenue. The building was located at the edge of Sutton Place, a highly affluent enclave just blocks from midtown and home, over the years, to such celebrities as Henry Kissinger, I. M. Pei, and Bill Blass. In 1956, Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe were the Alexanders' neighbors, occupying a penthouse apartment at 444 East 57th. Kathy's home, however, was somewhat more Sutton Place adjacent\u2014rent-controlled, relatively modest, on the small side. It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a sunken living room, a tiny kitchen. After Wendy was born, on July 1, 1949, the two girls shared a room, and would do so throughout their childhood and adolescence, a fact that forever vexed Kathy (she was still complaining about it with her psychic when she was in her late forties). In Requiem, one of her last works, Acker described the apartment thusly:\n            A small apartment\u2014its interior reveals that its inhabitants aren't all that wealthy. A narrow, dark green hall leads, on one side, to a large sunken living room, the largest room in the apartment. All the sofas and chairs in this room, of which there are many, have silk exteriors; the clear plastic that Claire explains are [sic] needed to protect the pale silks from stains are never taken off except when there are guests. There are a number of antiques including a captain's desk in which there are hiding places, a table whose inlaid pads are the color of ivy. A cabinet replete with china dogs supervises the large writing desk, of the same wood, beneath it. No one ever uses this desk. Acker also recalled that she wasn't permitted to put up any pictures or photographs on the walls of her room, and that Claire, despite spending lots of money on her own clothes and furnishings, never changed the rose-patterned drapes or the green paint on the walls of her daughters' room. Even as they grew into teenagers, Kathy and Wendy still had the same single beds they slept in as children. Kathy's refuge, as a young child, was the tiny park at the end of the street, beside the East River, where she sometimes went to play with her mother. For Kathy, the park offered possibility and solitude, as well as access to the natural world (as domesticated as it was), the sea, even other lands. In Great Expectations, this park is the site of a rare, enchanted, but ultimately fleeting, Christmas moment she shares with Claire: \"I stay in this magic snow with the beautiful yellow sun beating down on me as long as I can until a voice in my head (me) or my mother says, 'Now you know what this experience is, you have to leave.'\" In all of her books, Acker describes the family home as a \"prison,\" though, in many ways, it was far more ordinary and comfortable than that. Indeed, the outward conventionality of Acker's early childhood offers no hint of her future restlessness or iconoclasm. Bowers recalled that the family ate dinner together every night, then the girls would do their homework. Afterward, they would all retreat to Claire and Bud's bedroom, where they kept their only TV, and the family would gather on the bed and watch together. As she got older, Kathy rarely participated in this ritual, preferring to read alone in her room. The poodles were an ever-present feature of the apartment, both amusement and annoyance. Wendy and Kathy got along reasonably well, though even then they were clearly different\u2014the former more athletic and less bookish. Both girls were extremely sheltered. Their early lives were a small, closed circuit: school, home, school, home. If they went anywhere else\u2014to Broadway shows, Rockefeller Center, to the park at the end of the street\u2014it was always with their parents or grandmother. Among the many objects that Acker possessed at her death was an album of family photographs. It was large and pumpkin orange, its plastic cover smudged and tacky from decades of handling. Inside, glued to pages of faded, occasionally torn scrapbook paper, were just over a hundred black-and-white photographs of Kathy, Wendy, and other family members, some identified, some not. Here was baby Kathy at six weeks, held by Claire; a two-year-old Kathy, in Bud's arms, outside a Gristedes supermarket. In a photo taken in Westport, Connecticut, Kathy and Wendy pose in the grass with a nameless spaniel and their grandmother's African-American housekeeper, Grace Brown, who often served as their nanny. Aside from a photograph of Kathy talking on the phone, in which she looks to be about twelve, all of the pictures in the album are of her as an infant or young child. \"I tried to run away from the pain named childhood,\" Acker writes in My Mother: Demonology, \"like you flush a huge shit down the toilet. I've been running ever since.\" But here, in these photographs at least, there's little evidence of this pain. There is, in fact, only its opposite: a smiling, tiny Kathy, perched on a pony, or beaming beside a Christmas tree, seemingly cherished by everyone around her. She looks like a sweet child, with plump lips and dark, expressive eyes. She doesn't seem to mind the camera, and in most of these pictures, smiles broadly (and much more frequently than Wendy, at least). Of course, a single family photo album is a small, overdetermined, and unrepresentative sample. It shows little, proves nothing. But it was apparently the only trace of her family that Acker held on to throughout her adult life, and it remains the only real record of Acker's youth. It's easy to imagine Acker coming back again and again to these images as inspirational prods for her writing. Or perhaps simply to return to a bygone, relatively innocent time, reminding Acker of what she was like before the abandonment and death that would shadow her later years. Many of the photographs show the girls at the beach. When Kathy was seven or eight, Florrie bought a summer home in Atlantic Beach, on the South Shore of Long Island. Thereafter, the family vacationed there every year, driving out as soon as school ended. Bud would still work in the city and would commute by train at the end of the day. The house was a block from the beach, and for some reason, Florrie was a member of one beach club, and Bud and Claire a different one. In any case, until they went to camp in Maine in their early adolescence, Kathy and Wendy spent every summer day at the ocean. By all accounts, Kathy was always much closer to her Nana than to anyone else in the family. Where Claire seemed weak and dependent, Florrie was a confident, self-reliant survivor. \"She saw Florrie as a tower of strength,\" Pooh Kaye said, \"and someone who got her way.\" Kathy craved Florrie's admiration and respect, things that Claire also presumably desired but never seemed to receive. Florrie was more cultured than Claire as well\u2014she was the one who took Kathy and Wendy to galleries and museums. When Acker first began to self-publish, she sent her chapbooks to Florrie, and, according to Kaye, her grandmother was \"full of praise, much to Kathy's surprise and complete delight.\" Bowers concurred with this: \"She understood what she was trying to accomplish with her writing. I think my grandmother understood Kathy better than my mother did.\" In Acker's writing, Claire is villain and victim at once, and above all, a black hole\u2014all-consuming, unknowable. \"I'm probably concerned with my mother in my texts,\" Acker wrote in an essay late in life. \"I'm concerned with the father and my mother.\" The French feminist philosopher Luce Irigaray gave Acker some theoretical ballast here, arguing that, in a patriarchal culture, women are compelled to have a doubled, ambiguous relationship with their mothers: \"On the one hand, my mother was or is my lover,\" Acker wrote. \"On the other hand, my mother was a victim in the male-defined society. So, if I identify with her, I'm forced to define myself as a victim. So how do I deal with this double bind? Go mad? (Pun intended.) Irigaray says we, females, have to reinstate the mother as another person. I take that rather seriously.\" It's frustrating therefore to have so little firsthand evidence of Claire's life and personality, other than, of course, Acker's words themselves. As the architect of her own myth, Acker was fortunate to have a family that did not keep records.I Outside of those published words, however, are the many notebooks and letters in which Acker worked out her fiction, drafted and rehearsed it, and the details within those pages are specific and consistent enough to constitute a portrait of some verifiable fidelity. \"Most of it is true,\" Wendy Bowers averred, when asked of the novels' accuracy. Bowers felt that she and Kathy had a happy early childhood, though Bowers also describes Claire as a \"very strict\" woman who completely controlled their young lives. \"I think we agreed about a lot of things about our mother, but I was able to accept who she was,\" Bowers said. \"I think my sister had a hard time with it.\" Indeed, the Claire that haunts Acker's writing is a complex and enigmatic figure, a mother both remote and authoritarian, malevolent and pathetic. From the beginning, when she gives Kathy a name that she hates, Claire makes her child an object of derision. She rarely expresses love or affection, never gives Kathy gifts, even at Christmas. When Kathy is very young, she has a beloved pink blanket, covered in appliqu\u00e9d roses; at some point, Claire takes it away to get cleaned and then never bothers to return it. She is also capable of physical cruelty; a story Acker told several people, and repeated in her writing, was that, on at least one occasion, Claire ambushed Kathy in the shower and threw a glass of cold water on her, apparently hoping that her daughter would slip and fall. In another, darker version of the story, Claire tried to drown her. All of these injustices, from the minor to the grave, deeply marked Acker. She tallied all the above in one of the notebooks she kept for her novel My Mother: Demonology, summing them up thusly: \"These are all the accounts of how my mother tried to kill me.\" Above all, in Acker's mind, Claire hated Kathy because Kathy ruined her life. By getting pregnant, Claire lost Kathy's father and was forced to settle for a marriage to a man she didn't really love, to sacrifice herself to a life of compromise and dissatisfaction. \"She tells him that he's worthless,\" she writes of Bud and Claire's marriage in Requiem. \"He has a job only because he married into the family, all the wealth is on her side of the family. He tells her that he bought her her first mink coat. They go through this every single day.\" For Kathy, Claire never fulfilled her potential, whatever that potential may have been. She was a quintessential 1950s American housewife, a dumb stereotype slowly wasting her life, ultimately consumed by her own dissatisfaction. Her most important role, then, for Kathy, was to serve as a negative example. Kathy looked at Claire and determined that she would live as differently as possible. She would lead a purposeful, creative, self-directed life. She would never let anyone tell her what to do. \"I have no sense of a person,\" Acker wrote of Claire, \"I have a sense of my mother. My mother was a person; she stopped me from doing what I wanted to do. I wanted to get away from her.\" And Acker would not place anyone's needs above her own. For the rest of her life, she would never really take responsibility for anyone other than herself. I. Pooh Kaye recalled that her own unstable mother cleaned out a trunk full of family letters and documents, including several letters from Acker to Kaye's father, Clifford, and replaced them, bizarrely, with McDonald's hamburger wrappers. ",
  "3": "THE POSTWAR AMERICA THAT KATHY grew up in was one of unprecedented prosperity and stability. The population boomed, government spending boomed, and there was a sense that the country was, or would soon become, almost entirely middle-class, both in terms of its values and its economy. While capitalism seemed to have triumphed, and consumerism was in ascendance, full employment and poverty relief were undeniably still goals, taxes were high, and the country was still a limited welfare state. Benefitting immensely from the countless European scientists, artists, and intellectuals who had found refuge in the United States, however, and with its industrial infrastructure intact and thriving, the country dominated global affairs. With many great European cities still in ruin, New York City reasserted itself as a global capital of commerce, art, and politics. A sense of conciliation and consensus prevailed. At the same time, the U.S. simmered with anxiety\u2014over Communism and its spread both internationally and within the country's borders; over the creeping corporatization of life and politics; over evolving ideas around race, family, and gender. Millions of women had entered the workforce during World War II, and while many returned to life as mothers and homemakers, the sense of expanded possibility led directly to the emergence of women's liberation the following decade. The development of the birth control pill, which began in 1950, further amplified this shift. While mainstream society extolled bureaucracy, conformity, and unity, a fledgling counterculture was taking shape in opposition to these values. The best-known representatives of this so-called Beat Generation were its literary stars\u2014Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William Burroughs\u2014who first congregated at Columbia University and in Greenwich Village. From the outset, Kathy was trained to do much more than keep house or raise children. In 1952, when she was five years old, she started at the Lenox School, an all-girls prep school located at 170 East 70th Street. The suffragette and educator Jessica Garretson Finch founded Lenox in 1916. A Barnard graduate who felt that her education had left her with no practical skills, Finch had previously started the Finch School (later Finch College) as a secondary school to prepare women for the working world; Lenox was, in turn, created to prepare girls for Finch. Lenox's four-story Renaissance Revival limestone building was built as a carriage house and horse stable in 1902 and purchased by Lenox in 1925.I By the standards of mid-century New York private schools, Lenox wasn't considered the finest education available, but it was unquestionably top-notch. Its head of school, Cecily Selby, was a renowned scientist with a degree in physics from Radcliffe and a doctorate in physical biology from MIT, and was working to make Lenox even more academically rigorous. Classes were small and intimate, and the teachers could be compelling, the curriculum strictly defined but ambitious. In grade seven, British history was mandatory; in grade eight, American. Students had to learn two additional languages, French and Latin. The school could be claustrophobic and regimented\u2014classes of twenty were divided into two sections, \"the smart and the not-smart,\" according to Linda Muller Vasu, one of Kathy's classmates\u2014but there was also often, Vasu said, a pervasive atmosphere of joy in its halls. Kathy was, apparently, a sterling student from the beginning: bright and bookish and hardworking. The cloistered, circumscribed life that she continued to lead\u2014it was still just school, home, Long Island\u2014might have been constricting, but it hadn't occurred to her yet to resist it. It's possible Kathy started writing during those earliest grades\u2014she later claimed that she won a poetry contest in the sixth grade\u2014but it's more likely her serious writing efforts didn't begin until high school, where she did, in fact, win a writing contest or two. Kathy's classmates were awash in money and privilege. By the time she got to high school, her classmates included Faith Golding, a real estate heiress whose father owned Essex House on Central Park and controlled the Sterling National Bank, and who, at eighteen, married twenty-two-year-old Ron Perelman, later one of Wall Street's most notorious corporate raiders and New York's richest man; Sherry Frawley, whose father was the proprietor of Pete's Tavern, the renowned Gramercy Park pub; and Betsy Kimmelman, daughter of hotelier Milton Kimmelman, who owned the Sherry-Netherland, the Ambassador, and the Barbizon, among many others. These were teenagers with their own chauffeurs and apartments. She and Wendy, on the other hand, took the bus to school. \"I was born a rich kid,\" Acker would later tell an interviewer, but at Lenox she learned that there were kids born much wealthier and more advantaged than she. In \"The Invisible Universe,\" an essay Acker published in 1982, she asks how a great writer comes into being. Her answer was characteristically overwrought, remarkable, and oblique, but in its run-on pileup of adjectives and nouns as revealing a self-portrait as any other she composed: \"Hatred antipathy to human fear of everything selfishness inability to communicate deformed physical attributes chronic illnesses moods-like-demons in particular: epileptic escapism, thundering na\u00efve desires?\" Books were a place for Kathy to engage that escapism, to satisfy her thundering na\u00efve desires. She started reading at an early age, and found in literature not just a place to escape but a place for everything. Books were the most romantic, even sacred, of objects; they were time machines, genie lamps, merit badges, force fields. They provided insulation from the actual life she led, and opened up the possibility of other, more captivating lives; she could, literally, lose herself in books. \"When I was a kid I always thought of books as more real than anything else,\" she told an interviewer. \"I had a bad childhood and books really were my reality.\" To write books, then, to become a writer herself, was to create her own reality. She could summon love, exorcise hatred, and ultimately exact revenge on those who had rejected or hurt her. She was a precocious reader too. While Claire read a fair bit also, mostly murder mysteries, Kathy told Wendy early in their youth that she was going to read \"every single classic.\" At Lenox, her classmates recalled, she proudly carried around Modern Library editions of those classics, their covers always faced outward to advertise their contents. The first adult authors she read were Dickens, Blake, and Hawthorne. As this peacocking suggests, Kathy was competitive too, and books and writing were her preferred arena. \"Books are the only people who like me,\" she wrote, half-jokingly, a decade later. This wasn't quite true of her in high school. Kathy had her fair share of friends there, and teachers who openly adored her. But nevertheless, just as at home, she felt apart, different, lonely. If she was not exactly an outcast, to a large extent she considered herself an outsider. She tended to lean into this difference and strangeness, but in truth, she occupied a more in-between position, one she found herself in throughout much of her life, in fact\u2014at once inside and outside, alienated and reconciled, blessed and cursed. In grade seven, she met twin sisters Linda and Susan Muller,II who would become both good friends and fierce rivals. The Mullers were outsiders of a sort too. Though well-off, their parents were divorced, an anomaly at the time; the girls lived on Park Avenue with their mother. Kathy and the Mullers were all in the \"smart\" section of their grade, and would meet for study dates or talk about their homework over the phone. Linda recalled that their conversations were largely a blur of checking in and one-upmanship, particularly once they all got to high school. \"Have you read this, have you done the math, what's your science project, what do you think about Gogol's The Overcoat?\" They sometimes played bridge at the Mullers' apartment, staying up until two or three in the morning, then heading to Reuben's, a twenty-four-hour deli, for a late-night, early morning breakfast. Linda remembered Kathy always wanting to be a writer, nothing else, and that she kept a commonplace book in which to chronicle her reading. But the Kathy she recalled was also an unabashed free spirit, physically unkempt and emotionally volatile. The Mullers were identical twins, and tall, blonde, and beautiful. Teenaged Kathy, in contrast, was small and somewhat gawky, with a mouth too big for her body, an effect she enhanced by not washing or combing her hair and often showing up to school in a grubby uniform. In retrospect, this seems like a deliberate, easy expression of defiance; it reinforced her sense of difference, her disregard for conventional behavior and appearance. To Linda, it suggested something more, that Kathy was virtually feral, basically unparented. \"She never cared about how she looked,\" Linda said. \"And most adolescents do. She was smelly. She was not particularly attractive. Nor was she friendly. She had the sorts of traits and values and mindset of a motherless female.\" In the classroom too, she was blithe about following rules, speaking without raising her hand, assertive and confrontational. Miraculously, her teachers usually tolerated such behavior; all was forgiven because of Kathy's academic brilliance and boundless curiosity. Linda found Kathy refreshingly authentic, particularly for a teenager, but she was also somewhat afraid of and for her. This feeling became more acute when Kathy began to have sex, the first girl, Linda remembered, in their class to do so. \"This was a huge thing in a girls' school,\" Linda said, \"and she defined herself early on in that way.\" By the ninth grade, the three girls were going to weekend parties, and Linda recalled Kathy drinking and then disappearing with whatever boy took an interest in her. Kathy would later brag about these exploits, but Linda was alarmed by Kathy's abandon and apparent heedlessness. \"She was sort of self-destructive,\" Linda said. I. Lenox itself merged with Birch Wathen in 1989 and is now the Birch Wathen Lenox School; the building became the home of the New York School of Design in 1993. II. In another instance of Acker's poor spelling or faulty memory, she typically misspells Muller as Mueller in her books. ",
  "4": "IN 1973, ACKER WROTE TWO books, Rip-off Red, Girl Detective and The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula, which sketched variations on an origin story that appears often in her work. In Rip-off Red, Acker includes several near-autobiographical paragraphs, such as this one: \"My mother tells me my 'father' isn't my real father: my real father left her when she was three months pregnant and wanted nothing to do with me, ever. This husband has adopted me. That's all she tells me. I feel happy that none of my adopted father's blood is in me.\" Acker suggests that this revelation occurred when she was eight years old, but according to her sister Wendy at least, this happened in somewhat different circumstances, when Kathy was thirteen. Sometime in the summer of 1960, the Alexanders were, as usual, vacationing in Atlantic Beach. Though Claire always tried to keep Bud's detested family away from hers, Bud's sister, Karen, and her daughter were also visiting. Earlier, somehow, the daughter had learned the truth about Kathy's parentage and had let Kathy in on the secret. Predictably, Kathy was shocked, then furious. As soon as she could, during dinner, she picked a fight with Bud, and when he tried to discipline her, she jumped up and screamed at him: \"You're not my real father! You can't tell me what to do!\" Wendy watched the scene, aghast. \"Obviously, this was the wrong way to find out,\" she said decades later. \"It had to be tough, really tough. It had a real impact on Kathy.\" Indeed, it's difficult to overstate the gravity of this moment. Kathy's life was instantly capsized. She wasn't who she thought she was. But who was she? Who was her family? Why had her mother withheld this information from her? Claire had been abandoned but Kathy now knew that she had been abandoned too\u2014before she was even born. To make matters worse, once the story was out, Claire also refused to tell Kathy who exactly her birth father was. She wouldn't talk about it. Bud had officially adopted her, Claire said; he was Kathy's real father. The identity of her birth father didn't matter. For Kathy, who despised Bud and who felt that Claire actually did too, this was wrong, impossible, and cruel. Many children think that their parents don't understand them, or that they are simply not like them. Others believe, or fantasize, that they have literally been born into the wrong family. Kathy's cousin, Pooh Kaye, thought this definitely applied to Kathy: \"She was like a cuckoo in the wrong nest. She landed in the wrong place.\" Such children must, therefore, they believe, be adopted\u2014that would explain their alienation from the people they are supposed to love, who are supposed to love them. Their real families, the ones they're related to by blood\u2014they must be more interesting and impressive, wealthier, more significant, than the one they've been burdened with. Suddenly, this fantasy became real for Kathy. Throughout her adolescence and early twenties, she would speculate, sometimes wildly, about her true patrimony. \"I began to think about my father,\" Acker wrote in a later notebook, \"the one who made my mother pregnant. If he's alive, he'll treat me kindly. Why I have no reason to think this. No one treats me kindly; I'm a miserable kid. Why do I think my father'll treat me kindly (my mother didn't teach me this: she hates men)?\" At the same time, the knowledge that her real father, whoever he might be, had abandoned her, now provided license and justification. The seesaw of seduction and betrayal\u2014others', but also her own\u2014that characterized her childhood would now also shape many of her future personal and professional relationships. This fact also immediately lent her life a literary shape. At times, she seemed to have felt that ichor coursed through her veins; at many others, she considered herself unwanted, rejected. In both interviews and her fiction, then, she cast her beginnings as equal parts Hansel and Gretel, Moll Flanders, and Electra. Jean Genet, modern literature's most famous foundling, became her idol. Rimbaud, himself forsaken by his father and raised by an authoritarian mother, became the subject of Acker's 1990 novel In Memoriam to Identity. Fictional orphans and near orphans\u2014Jane Eyre, Pip, Jim Hawkins, Huckleberry Finn\u2014would provide additional inspiration and models. \"Kathy always struck me as somebody who was living in raw mythology,\" said her friend the comic book writer Alan Moore. \"I think she experienced the events in her life in mythological terms; that this was sometimes to the detriment of her emotional relationships; but that nevertheless it was the essential fuel that powered her writing and her personality.\" Everything seemed to change in this instant at Atlantic Beach. Kathy was, in effect, reborn. Her relationship with Claire, increasingly strained, fell apart. They fought constantly, and Kathy began to defy her mother any way she could. During the week, Kathy and Wendy wore their school uniforms, but even on weekends Claire forbade the girls to wear blue jeans. Kathy nonetheless stashed a pair in the apartment building's garbage room, and before going out, would sneak in there to change. She started to smoke and taught her cousins how to do so too. \"Growing up, she was the apple of my parents' eye,\" Wendy said. \"Then, all of a sudden, she started changing, getting her own mind. She just became determined that she was going to do what she wanted to do.\" And, again, Kathy sought solace in books. In I become Jane Eyre who rebelled against every one, an abandoned project that she likely intended to become an additional Black Tarantula book, she writes: \"I remember: the first time I remember exerting control over my being I decided to follow the things said in my books rather than my parents' hints and instructions. When I felt anxious doing experiencing something new, if I could find a precedent for the event in a book I liked I kept doing thinking feeling whatever.\" Many books, of course, contained romance and sex, and it was here that Kathy most flagrantly rebelled. According to Kathy, Claire told her very little about sex, and what information she did impart was bizarre and inappropriate: That \"petting\" wasn't that bad, but that Kathy still shouldn't do it because it led to other things. That her menstrual blood was carrot or tomato juice. That Bud's penis was too small. As with Claire's behavior during Kathy's childhood, her having actually made these claims is impossible to verify, but their consistent repetition in Acker's fiction, notebooks, and correspondence suggest at least a kernel of truth. Acker later claimed she barely even knew any boys until the eighth grade, but from thirteen or fourteen on, she started making up for lost time. In both Rip-off Red and The Childlike Life, Acker writes, in the sub-section titled \"Age 13\": \"I fuck and find out my mother's been lying. I know my mother lies about everything. We outwardly hate each other.\" Two decades later, in a letter to her friend, the English writer Glenda George, Acker recounted that first sexual experience in exacting detail. Kathy was dating, she said, a fourteen-year-old boy named Dale Hemmerdinger, a student at the posh Riverdale Country School and the scion of a prominent real estate development family. In one of the buildings the Hemmerdingers owned, Dale had his own private apartment, one floor below his parents, where he would throw wild parties free of parental supervision. Possibly at one of these parties, or on a separate date, according to Acker, Hemmerdinger seduced her. Retrospectively, at least, the encounter was confusing, pleasurable, and illuminating, all at once:\n            \u2026 he's holding me like a baby and the fingers are inside my cunt and the next date or two dates later I don't remember I don't remember anything he's laying on top of me and rubbing and I like that a lot cause it makes me feel warm and we've got our clothes off and I'm sick of not doing things why I shouldn't do them I don't know and they feel so good and then he sticks this thing in me and I don't like it at all it doesn't hurt but it's uncomfortable and I can't figure out why he's doing it but it doesn't take too long and then he goes back to the cuddling so I figure if he has to do this weird stick-in thing so he'll do what I like that's O.K. and that night I go home and figure out while I'm lying in my bed that that's what fucking was somehow in my confused mind I thought men and women had babies by rubbing asses and sort of shitting together, it was confused, and my mother wanting to be WASP didn't tell me anything\u2026 Hemmerdinger, who would go on to become a developer himself, as well as chair of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, had no recollection of these liaisons and barely any of Kathy herself. He did acknowledge that he dated girls from Lenox; in fact, he married one, Elizabeth Gould, who was in a class ahead of Kathy. Gould, for her part, only remembered Kathy as \"fast.\" It's possible that Acker, a couple decades after the fact, was confusing Hemmerdinger with another boy; it's equally possible that she made little impression on Hemmerdinger. Whatever the truth, in her letter to George, Acker acknowledged the narrative power that fucking could have: \"Sex is terrific five years later when it becomes a story.\" Indeed, this particular episode did become a story, a vivid one, in Rip-off Red. Some details were changed\u2014here, the narrator is just ten years old, her paramour has the Dickensian name of Hammerblunt, the school he attends is called Riversmell. Acker's description of their sexual encounter hews closely to what she told George but takes on a more ecstatic tone: \"We were both giggling madly, two waves, or sheets opening the nerves twisted upward from my cunt, I wanted him to continue\u2026\" The scene functions primarily, however, as an erotic tale that Rip-off Red recounts as a way to seduce her own sister, and then even this incestuous encounter serves largely as a pretext for Red's eventual escape and reinvention: \"That night my sister and I, frightened out of our wits, split the city. My sister disappeared; I went to the coast, changed my name to Rip-off Red, started to starve. As far as I know, the police never searched for my sister and me: in New York they only care about pot-heads and political kids. I never saw anyone I knew in my childhood, again.\" Elsewhere, and even earlier in her writing career, Acker put this a somewhat different way. Sex, she claimed, wasn't in fact all that pleasurable for her as a teenager, but being a \"big tough sex queen\"\u2014that is, being regarded as someone adventurous, brave, and experienced\u2014had a profound value all its own. In Poems 5/71\u20136/71, a typescript from 1971, she wrote, \"the actual physical pleasure was of course minimal compared to the pleasure of becoming who I wanted to become\u2026\" ",
  "5": "JUST AS KATHY WAS BECOMING sexually active, so too was she beginning to take writing more seriously. It's uncertain how old she was exactly when she started producing poetry and fiction, but 1960, as far as anyone knows, was the first year Kathy published any of it. That year, when she was in the eighth grade, the Lenox literary magazine, the Quill, printed a two-paragraph piece she entitled \"Night.\" Less prose poem than vignette or sketch, thick with atmospheric description, it's set in a decaying English fishing village at an indeterminate time. In it, a young vagrant\u2014variously, \"a pitiful lad,\" \"a pathetic youth,\" \"the ragged creature,\" \"the debilitated youth\"\u2014starving and despondent, drowns himself in the \"waves that had been a mother to him for as long as he could remember.\" The piece is assured, sophisticated, ambitious. It's intriguing that the subject is a boy\u2014already, Acker is playing with gender\u2014and that the setting and \"plot\" are so removed from Kathy's own lived experience. It's useful to remember that American poets were then enamored of their British counterparts, and there are echoes in \"Night\" of Dylan Thomas and John Cowper Powys, Kipling and Dickens. Kathy's own favorite poet was, at the time, Gerard Manley Hopkins. Many years later, she said that her teachers explicitly taught her that the English novel was the novel and that American novelists should be considered a \"treat.\" Dickens and Blake were among the first adult authors she read; they \"exploded open in my mind a visionary landscape called London,\" she later wrote. Other English writers\u2014Austen, Trollope\u2014provided a different lesson, showing how the traditional novel could reify the divisions of society. Such novels, she came to believe, mapped out hierarchies of class, gender, and species, and used language that mirrored this order. \"The language of the novel had to be proper,\" she wrote, \"elegant and ironic, even when the characters were depraved lower class hoodlums.\" As an adult, Acker would regularly revolt against such dicta, but her juvenilia was deeply influenced by this. Throughout the next few years of high school, she published one or two pieces in the Quill, most of them in the purple prose poem style of \"Night.\" In grades ten and eleven, she wrote two other poems\u2014\"Phantasmagoria\" and \"Variation on a Theme: Based on Romeo and Juliet, II, ii\"\u2014which, in their line breaks and meter, are more conventionally poetic and which won Kathy first place, two years in a row, in the school's poetry contest. As a prize, Kathy received a copy of Final Harvest: Emily Dickinson's Poems, originally published in 1961 and inscribed by her beloved English teacher Jean St. Pierre, who paraphrased both Walter Pater and Shakespeare: \"To Kathy, In whom the gem-like flame of poetry burns brightly. For we\u2026 Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise. With love, Jean St. Pierre.\" Kathy kept the book for the rest of her life. Decades later St. Pierre reappears in her novel My Mother: Demonology, as a kind, protective teacher who introduces the narrator to Melville, Keats, Yeats, and The Wizard of Oz. \"Variation on a Theme: Based on Romeo and Juliet, II, ii\" is especially compelling, if only for its hints of Acker's later methods. Here, Kathy takes a found text\u2014a staple of high school classes around the English-speaking world\u2014and reworks it to suit her own, somewhat inscrutable, purpose:\n                \n         \n            So still the night. The moon has frozen all: So still black limbs of trees O'er which soar silent doves\u2014 black doves against a moon\u2014 And still these winter winds Which seep into my soul\u2026 Tybalt is dead! How can It be so cold. So still, so silent, deep? Yes Tybalt dead! O where Are black-plumed mourners Paid with icy thorns? And where The sound of that foul murd'rer's flight? A curse on him\u2026 on him who plunged My kinsman to ignoble dust, on him Who trampled careless on our love, A curse on this base pity\u2026 The night is still Wild doves have left And black 'compasses all; Tybalt is dead! But I care not\u2026 Except his slayer's plight Makes scared my struggling soul; O Tybalt dead! That thought Should bring new rage, New incest to my mind; and yet, In still of night On barren lifeless rocks I only fear for him\u2026 Birth's bonds are severed\u2014 Gaze with hate on my torn mind O moon\u2026 for nought I care A raucous fire leaves my soul, Like winter trees, Spent of all doubts. O soulless night Be hushed, and icy winds; four nought I care. This cruel live Casts out all black and still.  In an interview several years later, long after Acker had become renowned for her appropriation, she would return to this poem as evidence of both the consistency of her literary vision and its early origins: \"In high school, I was always imitating Shakespeare, redoing poems from Romeo and Juliet and so on. It's been that way ever since. What this comes down to, I think, is that I've never liked the idea of originality, and so my whole life I've always written by taking other texts, inhabiting them in some way so that I can do something with them.\" Shakespeare's play had personal resonance as well for Kathy, who was by then involved in her own fervid, forbidden romance. In the summer of 1963, she was taking courses at Trinity College's summer school in Hartford, Connecticut, a program that was open to students at the college, but also to high schoolers like Kathy who had excellent grades. There's no record of what she studied at Trinity, but those weeks would prove formative. In the dining hall one day, she met a freshman at the college named P. Adams Sitney. He was nineteen, three years older, an ambitious, snobby, self-styled intellectual, both an aspiring classicist and a devoted cineaste, and arguably even more precocious than Kathy herself. In high school in nearby New Haven, he'd formed a film society where he showed new and classic films and published a magazine that included the likes of Stan Brakhage and Ana\u00efs Nin. He even managed to persuade Jean Cocteau to draw one cover. He favored three-piece suits and black-rimmed glasses and was extremely gaunt; Kathy, he said, weighed more than him at the time. A long red beard gave him a Mephistophelian mien. That summer at Trinity, Sitney was studying Greek and was obsessed with Ezra Pound, Propertius, and Charles Olson, heady poets who were largely unfamiliar to Kathy and which he gleefully foisted on her. He found Kathy highly intelligent, eager, and \"slightly wild in a ragamuffin mode.\" Like him, she had Ivy League aspirations\u2014Sitney would eventually transfer to Yale, where he would study Sanskrit\u2014and he expected her to one day become a prominent academic. Her curiosity was a marvel to him, and he fed it with commensurate zeal. \"She was a real live wire,\" he said, \"filled with enthusiasm when she liked something. I was constantly pouring things on her.\" He gave her at least three Olson books (The Distances, The Maximus Poems, and Call Me Ishmael), and, for her seventeenth birthday, a copy of La Femme 100 t\u00eates, Max Ernst's remarkable first collage novel. Later that fall, Sitney temporarily dropped out of school and moved to a rooming house near Cooper Square in Manhattan, where he dedicated himself, more or less, to the underground and experimental filmmakers that lived in the city. This flourishing scene began with Maya Deren and Kenneth Anger and continued with Brakhage, Andy Warhol, and Jack Smith, just to name the most enduringly famous. These were fiercely independent artists who captured the convulsions of modern dance and religious ritual (Deren), who extolled the occult and homoerotic (Anger), who sought to depict visual perception itself (Brakhage), who upended the traditional star system and classical forms of acting (Smith, Warhol), who upended received ideas of filmic time (all of them). Jonas Mekas, the so-called godfather of this movement, had invited Sitney to become an editor at his magazine, Film Culture, when Sitney was still in high school, and after Sitney moved to New York, Mekas asked his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to help organize and tour an exhibition of new American films through Europe. But until Sitney departed for the continent later that year, Sitney and Kathy saw each other almost every day. He took her to movies, of course, but also to plays, including the now legendary off-Broadway production of Genet's The Blacks, starring James Earl Jones, Cicely Tyson, and Maya Angelou. He introduced her to many of the cultural figures he knew\u2014Smith and Mekas and the filmmaker and artist Carolee Schneemann, the poets Parker Tyler, Robert Kelly, and Jackson Mac Low, the Fluxus linchpins Dick Higgins and George Maciunas. He urged her to read Rimbaud and Mallarm\u00e9. They frequently hung out at the one-room office of the Film-Makers' Cooperative on Park Avenue South, but as often as he could, Sitney took Kathy back to his room on East 4th Street so they could have sex. The place was cramped, furnished entirely with a desk and a bed, with a rope that hung across its length for drying laundry and a filthy toilet in the hall. Sitney eventually gave Kathy a key, though he was always fearful he'd be busted for squiring around an underage high school student. Not that the denizens of the rooming house would have likely cared or even noticed; Sitney's neighbors were mostly junkies and, at one point, the Beat poet Gregory Corso. On at least one occasion, Sitney brought out a Super-8 camera and filmed a nude Kathy in bed. On Friday, November 22, 1963, John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Kathy was at Lenox and, she recalled, the students and faculty all gathered in the main auditorium, where a TV was wheeled in so they could watch the rest of the day unfold. Everyone was sobbing. Kathy was confused, uncertain about what had happened and why. In her confusion, she said, she fled the school and went downtown to see Sitney. They met at the Film-Makers' Co-op, and there too, people were mourning. But, Acker recounted, the filmmakers in that room weren't upset about Kennedy; they were mourning Jean Cocteau, who, Acker believed, had committed suicide because he was so distraught over the accidental death of his dear friend, the singer \u00c9dith Piaf. Cocteau and Piaf, in fact, died a month before Kennedy was shot, with the former already convalescing from a heart attack earlier in the year. But Acker's gloss on these events was in the service of a more personal, romantic lesson: \"On that day, for me the child, there were two distinct worlds: the world of politicians political assassinations schools correct learning, and the world of artists. Artists were those who lived by and died for love.\" In Kathy's 1961 yearbook, below a class picture, the name of each of the twenty students is accompanied by a motto, expression, or epigram. Whether these were chosen, bestowed, or both is unclear; some are glib (\"Quarterbacks are her specialty\"), others banal (\"Laughter is the Best Medicine\"). Kathy's motto was plucked from Virgil: Amor Vincit Omnia, or \"Love conquers all.\" This sentiment would become much more complicated (and, to a degree, less positive) for Kathy over time, but it was largely true when she was a teenager. With Sitney, love\u2014and sex\u2014could relieve the oppression of parents, the dull expectations of society. Despite Hemmerdinger and however many other adolescent flings, Sitney was Acker's first real love, in large part because he provided entry into artistic worlds that she was just discovering. SoHo and the Village were only a subway ride away from Sutton Place, but might as well have been a different galaxy. These worlds were at once delightful and dangerous, eye-opening and mind-expanding. \"Growing up as a kid, given my class background, my religious background, or what not, I was expected to marry well,\" she wrote in a late essay, \"or, when my parents realized I wasn't going to do that, I was expected to be a doctor or a lawyer or a scientist, and that was all that was allowed. I wasn't going to fit into any of those roles. So I found a sort of pocket. 'Bohemia.' At that time, there was something called 'Bohemia' and it made a lot of sense. I lived in Bohemia.\" How much she actually loved the brash, brainy, horny Sitney is uncertain\u2014later on, when older, she'd dismiss him as a misogynist\u2014but at the time, she revered, and desperately wanted, what he represented. Sitney relished his role as an avant-garde Pygmalion, and Kathy in turn avidly absorbed his teachings and influence. While earlier she had dreamed of being a poet, now she knew real ones, and could see, up close and in detail, how one might become, and live, as a poet, a dancer, a painter, a filmmaker. In My Mother: Demonology, she writes, \"This hint that it was possible to live in a community other than my parents', a community that wasn't hateful or boring, one of intellectuals, by opening up the world of possibilities, saved me from despair and nihilism.\" Kathy was suddenly in the company of openly gay people, drug addicts, geniuses, provocateurs, outcasts. She saw explicitly how art could be created in opposition or in parallel to a hegemonic, calcified culture. How communities and institutions\u2014the Film-Makers' Co-op was formed in 1962\u2014coalesced around that opposition. Here were filmmakers who had taken a commercial, even industrial, narrative form and thoroughly interrogated and subverted its materiality, its adherence to certain dramatic structures, its creative ambitions, who saw in it, who created from it, an art of endless visionary potential. For the first time\u2014but far from the last\u2014a historic cultural ferment swirled around Acker. In a story that she often later repeated, Jack Smith told her that he wanted to build a huge dome in North Africa, where people could come and tell him their dreams, and he would then turn these dreams into films that would be screened twenty-four hours a day. She was enchanted by this idea. In her future books, she would reproduce elaborate maps of her own dreams. Acker would go on to describe this period with deep affection and gauzy exaggeration. She liked to refer to herself as a friend, or even mascot, to Smith and Warhol and this whole band of outsiders. The truth, Sitney said, was quite a bit different; she watched and listened, but said very little. She was shy, made no impression. But she was just a teenager. Still just a girl, still, indeed, usually dressed in her school uniform. What could she say to these men? How many of them even noticed her? Most of these artists were fifteen, twenty years older than she was, completely consumed by their work. When Sitney wasn't treating Kathy as a project or sexual plaything, he used her as a secretary, once having her deliver manuscript pages of Brakhage's Metaphors on Vision, which Sitney was editing, to Dick Higgins's loft in SoHo, where the book was being produced. But in her same essay about this bohemia, and obviously with hindsight, Acker writes that all of this was simultaneously strategic and necessary. This was how a young woman in the early sixties was forced to navigate the world, even the relatively liberated realm of the avant-garde:\n                You know, one makes various compromises or rather, one puts on various masks, identic masks or identities, in order to survive. So, when I was in my teens, I hung around one of the forms of Bohemia, the poetry world; it was mainly guys there, a few women, but very few; you could see those women being on the edges of hysteria in order to maintain their position in that world. My position, as a teenager, was to listen to the big men and to keep my mouth shut. And I did it. That was the only way I could have done it. Acker kept her romance with Sitney largely a secret. \"I couldn't tell either my parents or anyone at my school about him,\" she later wrote, \"for he was an artist. Artists are not acceptable boyfriends.\" She would sometimes tell Claire she was seeing a movie with friends, then sneak down to the Bowery. At other times, she enlisted a classmate's more presentable boyfriend to pretend to pick her up, then that couple would double-date with her and Sitney. The tension between her two lives came to a head in late November. That month, the Jewish Guild for the Blind held its Thanksgiving Eve Dinner Dance, an annual benefit for the charity and society ball. Nineteen sixty-three was the fiftieth anniversary of the guild, and thanks to Claire's volunteering, Kathy was selected as one of twenty-seven high school girls presented as debutantes. The event was held near Times Square, at the newly opened Americana, then the tallest hotel in the world. This was a major event for Bud and Claire\u2014it would be Kathy's \"coming out\" to society, essentially the announcement of her eligibility as a potential wife. They bought her a long, tight, white brocaded dress at Bergdorf's for the occasion. Unsurprisingly, Kathy found the whole idea appalling, and though she couldn't skip out on the actual event, she did forgo the rehearsal in favor of meeting Sitney. Claire somehow discovered this and was livid. Her response was so violent that Acker felt compelled to record it in both letters to friends and in her earliest fiction. \"One winter afternoon I manage to get out of the house,\" she writes in The Childlike Life. \"I take the subway to 9th Street and Third Avenue to see my lover P. We spend the afternoon fucking. When I get home around 6:00 P.M. my mother asks me where I've been. 'Just walking around.' 'Why weren't you at the rehearsal for the Jewish Guild for the Blind Coming-Out Dance?' 'I'm sorry; I forgot.' She starts slapping my face as hard as she can. 'Whore. Whore.'\u200a\" At the event itself, Kathy was presented by Bud, who escorted her down a short flight of stairs and then paraded her around the ballroom before their first dance, a foxtrot. Kathy's date was a boy\u2014his name lost to time\u2014that she later described as gay. As soon as they could, he and Kathy left the dance, went to the ballroom's bar, and got drunk. At some point in their relationship\u2014or perhaps after it had ended\u2014Kathy told Sitney that Bud had once caught her in bed with a boyfriend (possibly her second husband, Peter Gordon). A version of this scene recurs repeatedly throughout Acker's work, from her early prose poem \"Stripper Disintegration\" to the libretto Requiem. In Acker's writing, however, the moment usually takes an ominous cast, with a Bud-like character banishing the boyfriend and then making sexual advances toward a Kathy-like character. He is pathetic and needy; he kisses and gropes her. He retreats only when Kathy telephones her mother and tells her what's happening. While the scene is multilayered, with Acker using it emblematically, her frequent return to this moment does raise the possibility that Bud did sexually assault his stepdaughter. The unrelenting disgust with which Acker portrays him in her writing lends this even more credence. The frequency with which incest is represented too, even if portrayed figuratively or even ironically, only heightens this suspicion. It's impossible to know if Acker was actually sexually abused as a child or adolescent, by Bud or anyone else. It's likely we'll never know. But she never spoke about it with friends, or in the many interviews in which she discussed all manner of intimate and personal detail. The writer Melvyn \"Mel\" Freilicher, who would later become one of her closest friends, said that she never told him about any kind of childhood abuse, adding that \"it doesn't seem that she'd keep that kind of fact from her friends or the public at large.\" But other people who knew Acker at various times in her life\u2014the poet Harris Schiff and the musician Jill Kroesen, specifically\u2014who were themselves abused, recognized in her a shared trauma. \"One can read Kathy's work as being very much the literature of an abused child,\" the poet Ron Silliman, another friend, also argued. Ultimately, though, Acker wasn't dealing with assertion or information, but in ambiguity, ambivalence, and emotion. In a way, it didn't matter if her self-dramatization was factually true. The Bud character was no more real than the Kathy character, but both were expressions of larger truths about the oppression of women and children. \"There are things that are just too bone-marrow awful,\" the artist Carolee Schneemann said of Acker's work. \"And the culture doesn't really want to accept it.\" ",
  "6": "SOMETIME IN HIGH SCHOOL, KATHY acquired the nickname Cassandra. Nobody remembers how or why. Was it a play on her name, or perhaps a nod to her interest in Greek? Or was she actually given, like the mythological figure, to prophecies of disaster that no one believed? Her later novels are, in many ways, prescient; even if the sobriquet itself didn't last beyond Lenox, the spirit arguably did. The nickname is mentioned on her yearbook page in her senior year, part of the caption to an illustration of a headless statue, its foot planted on a box of books bound for India. Presumably, the books were charitable donations, and they are alluded to again in a paragraph that describes Kathy in rollicking, sardonic prose and which predicted her future literary success:\n            Some people think that Kathy is a beatnik; others claim that she is an existentialist; but Kathy says that she is just plain Kathy. Whatever she is, she is different. She's more intellectual than many members of her class; she reads more; and she acts more avant-garde. She practices a studied nonchalance, taking things in her stride, letting trivial matters in one ear and out the other. Her close friends complain of her \"stupid look.\" This look is the only facial expression that she uses when she hears the names of baseball players and television actors that she cannot recognize. It is possible that in the next shipment of books to India Kathy might be added to the cargo, for it is noticed that she often has unreasonable arguments with Mrs. Bacon. Despite Kathy's exotic, but sometimes esoteric mind, she might, one day, return to Lenox, as the Poet Laureate. In the accompanying photograph, \"just plain Kathy\" does, indeed, look fairly plain: her hair is cut into a glossy flip that hangs just above her shoulders, her mouth agape in a slight, gap-toothed grin. Was this her \"stupid\" look? She's all head, all face, disembodied\u2014below the neck, her shoulders and torso have been airbrushed into oblivion. Sometimes, maybe, Kathy would have liked to have just been a head, a brain. Her body was, and always would be, incredibly important to her\u2014a site of great pleasure, power, and knowledge. She would later write that she wanted to create, in fact, a \"literature of the body,\" and she bristled against any theoretical separation of mind and body. \"When reality is up for grabs,\" she said, \"the body itself becomes the only thing you can return to.\" But she also often regarded her body as inadequate, ugly, and needy, a problem, a source of dread. It was something she strove to master and something to which she constantly submitted. Plagued by various painful illnesses for much of her adult life, it would betray her again and again. After Sitney left for Europe that winter, Kathy refocused on her studies. In her senior year, she was president of the U.N. Club and a member of the Dramatics Club. She had her sights set on attending Radcliffe College, Harvard's sister school and arguably the best university in the country for women. This was Claire's hope too. As Acker writes in her novel My Mother: Demonology, marrying a rich, old WASP was the best way for a young Jewish woman \"to travel from the school into the world outside,\" and the only other acceptable path was to extend their education. \"My parents and teachers, aware that I will not by nature marry a rich man, explained to me that by attending a top college I still kept the possibility of a rich or 'decent' marriage. If I was so evil that I couldn't even do that, I would at worst learn to be a top-flight scientist or lawyer.\" But Radcliffe wasn't meant to be. And, again, the Muller twins, Kathy's enduring rivals, were partly to blame. They too had their hearts set on Radcliffe. But Radcliffe was a small school; it had quotas. There was no way it would take any more than two students from a single high school, and the principals at schools with students who wanted to apply had to carefully select which applications they would support. Cecily Selby, Lenox's principal, herself a Radcliffe grad, decided to back Linda and Susan. The twins had the same excellent grades as Kathy, the same perfect SAT scores. And they were more physically attractive and better behaved, more obviously appealing candidates. Kathy was crushed. The rejection had even more sting because she had been excluded from the outset, barred from even attempting admission. She felt like an outcast once again. And, for whatever reason, she hadn't applied to any other similarly elite college\u2014none of the other Seven Sisters schools, or Pembroke, or the University of Pennsylvania, all of which would have likely taken her. Her lone safety school was Brandeis University, a Jewish-sponsored, nonsectarian, coed liberal arts college also located in Eastern Massachusetts, which did accept her. The Mullers, meanwhile, didn't get into Radcliffe anyway; both ended up at Wellesley. Grudgingly, Kathy went to Brandeis. But even once there, she couldn't stop talking about Radcliffe, and for the first few weeks of her freshman year, she let everyone know that she didn't belong there, that she deserved better. But Brandeis was arguably a better fit. Geographically, it was still close to Radcliffe, about a twenty-minute drive into the Boston suburb of Waltham. And from its contemporary architecture to its iconoclastic faculty, it also signified a distinct and appealing modernity. There were no Greeks, hardly any preppies. The student body was small, only about three hundred students per class, and many of them were Beatniks, artists, intellectuals, and misfits\u2014the type of people that Kathy now felt more comfortable around. Leonard Bernstein had once taught there, and Irving Howe and Max Lerner were on the faculty when Kathy arrived. The faculty's most notorious member was Herbert Marcuse, the marvelous, maddening Frankfurt School refugee. Marcuse had mashed up Marx and Freud, insisted on society's liberation from consumerism and capitalistic consciousness. An old man enthralled with the young, he was the guru of the New Left; his 1964 book The One-Dimensional Man was the unofficial handbook of Students for a Democratic Society, and two of his students, Angela Davis and Abbie Hoffman, would go on to become celebrities of the movement. He clashed frequently with Brandeis president Abram Sachar, who called him \"corrosive\" and \"biting,\" \"a rallying point in the offbeat youth movements, along with Ch\u00e9 Guevara and Mao Tse-tung.\" Contrary to the story that she herself later promulgated, Kathy never studied directly with Marcuse,I but his influence was undeniable. \"Art breaks open a dimension inaccessible to other experience,\" he wrote in his last major work, The Aesthetic Dimension, \"a dimension in which human beings, nature, and things no longer stand under the law of the established reality principle.\" This idea, that art can serve as resistance to societal repression, would forever underscore Acker's writing. Sitney had provided an escape, but Brandeis offered the possibility, finally, of complete reinvention. Going to college meant she would, at long last, be free of the Upper East Side, free of Claire and Bud and Wendy and Nana. Free to fully embark on scholarly and amorous adventure. More importantly, she might find out who she really was. She knew she was different. But how different could she, would she, be? I. Acker also claimed, in at least one interview, to have lived with Angela Davis, though there's no evidence that she actually did. ",
  "7": "BRANDEIS WAS FULL OF BRIGHT, original people, but from the minute she arrived, Kathy was considered one of the brightest and most original. Akin to her high school years, she seesawed between confidence and insecurity, but her intelligence, looks, and intensity impressed almost everyone around her. She decided to major in classical studies on a campus in which there were few classics majors. She called herself a poet, touted herself an expert on avant-garde film. To friends and classmates, she seemed simultaneously vulnerable and experienced, feminine and androgynous. A fellow freshman named Jeff Weinstein, who later became a food writer and editor at the Village Voice, said, \"She was one of the beautiful ones. She dressed hot, very mod. She looked like one of the rich New Yorkers, and that's what I thought of her until I met her and found out she was serious.\" Kathy was so serious, in fact, that she ditched the first roommate she was assigned because the girl partied too much and Kathy couldn't concentrate on her studies. After requesting a room change, she was paired up instead with an eighteen-year-old fine art major from Great Neck, Long Island, named Tamar Diesendruck. This wasn't exactly a perfect match either. On their first day together, Diesendruck, who would go on to become an acclaimed composer, put on a Robert Johnson record as she unpacked her books. Kathy was appalled. She'd arrived with her own collection of jazz records, but she had never heard rural blues music before. That didn't stop her from declaring it \"garbage\" and demanding that Diesendruck never again play the album in her presence. \"She went ballistic,\" Diesendruck said. \"She thought it was stupid and that I was an idiot. I was very hurt.\" Months later, when a male classmate, who was a blues harp player, expressed his enthusiasm for the same music, Kathy revised her opinion and never complained about Diesendruck's records again. Other women in the dorm had easier relationships with Kathy. \"I remember her being kind and supportive,\" Debbie Anker, now a Harvard law professor, recalled. \"Everybody thought of her as having this edge, but I saw this other side of her. She was motherly.\" At one point, when the sixteen-year-old Anker was contemplating losing her virginity, Kathy was one of her most enthusiastic cheerleaders. But Kathy wouldn't be spending too much time in her dorm anyway. On the first day of class, she had shimmied up a willow tree in the quad, where a sophomore named Peter Gould spied her. He was struck by her beauty and outfit\u2014a pink tank top and jean shorts\u2014and impulsively scurried up the other side of the tree so they could meet at the top. An aspiring writer, Gould had spent the previous summer in Guatemala and Belize, part of that time at a leper colony. But he was also shy and sensitive, a stutterer, from small-town Pennsylvania, and he felt that Kathy was, in many ways, his opposite: an urbane, wild New Yorker, more intensely emotional and imaginative than anyone he had ever met. But, as he would soon learn, she also loved books and literature as deeply as he did, perhaps more so. He was instantly bewitched. They chatted for a while in the willow, then descended and left campus, walking and talking along the banks of the Charles River for hours. Two days after their initial meeting, Gould snuck Kathy into his dorm so they could have sex. It was his first time, and, fifty years later, his memory of that night was still vivid. They fell asleep, and then woke again just before midnight. Kathy got out of bed and Gould watched with delight as she paraded nude across the floor, bathed in the orange mercury light that leaked through the curtains. \"Do you like me?\" she asked. The question made no sense to Gould. Of course he did. All he felt was overwhelming gratitude. The next day, he ran into Kathy in the dining hall. Tentatively, he asked if he could see her again that Friday. \"Of course, silly,\" she said. \"Saturday too. We're going together.\" They became inseparable that entire school year, their lives an alternating current of sex and study. Almost every night, Kathy and Gould shared a table at the library and read there, shoes off, their feet in each other's lap, until it closed around midnight. Occasionally, she shoplifted at the Brandeis bookstore, slipping books under her shirt that she later gave to Gould with the inscription \"Love, Me.\" That fall, student political activism, ignited by the civil rights movement and spurred on by the escalating conflict in Vietnam, roiled college campuses all across the country. Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), formed at the University of Michigan a few years earlier, was becoming a national force. At Berkeley, the Free Speech Movement was born, the first mass act of civil disobedience of the 1960s, and the progenitor of protests, sit-ins, and other demonstrations throughout the country. Malcolm X visited Brandeis in April 1963, and over time the student body became just as restive as those at Columbia and San Francisco State. In 1969, Black students occupied Ford Hall, Brandeis's main academic building, and demanded, among other things, the creation of an African and African American studies department. They were successful; Brandeis created one of the first such departments in the country. Kathy was sympathetic to and supportive of this activism. But unlike her friends Debbie Anker and Mel Freilicher, a psych major from Yonkers, who faithfully, forcefully participated in rallies, marches, and organizing efforts, she would have been called an activist by neither herself nor anyone who knew her then. She would later exaggerate her affiliation with SDS, and her books contain an undeniable political dimension, but the barricades she went to were in her brain. \"I didn't go down south and fight with the blacks,\" she said later. \"I was always on the periphery being an artist.\" Maybe not exactly being an artist, but at least someone figuring out how to become one. She was studying ancient Greek and, still under Sitney's influence, taking courses in the history of cinema. She continued to write poetry, efforts that Gould recalled as \"imitations of Sappho.\" Only one piece from those days appears to have survived\u2014an erotic ode titled \"To Peter Lee Gould\"\u2014but it's braided with the classical references that frequently adorn Acker's later writing and opens with an echo of the poem that concludes her novel Blood and Guts in High School:\n                \n                    \n                        boy of the slim hips, alone on the windy shore of Lesbos. what shall you dance in the wind. in the seas. \n                        too many poets have vowed on these shores to the dim Attis. and now we hardly remember. \n                        too many feet have tread the measures, dipping and rising with the heaving dolphins, silver on the black fish-scales. you, too, Orpheus you were there, teaching the wild virgins who sent you down to Hell\u2026 \n                        and here again, to guard this boy in his first dance to the god. \n                        may his feet touch the penis measures his voice crazed with the winds. O first mother, black singer of Lesbos, rise in the boy erect! let him ride your dolphins, which few have ridden, down to death!  As at Lenox, Kathy continued to be a dutiful, conscientious student. But more culturally knowledgeable now, she also strained against the limitations of the curriculum. Brandeis's literature department, she felt, was \"still living in the 19th century,\" and in the grip of New Critics like John Crowe Ransom, and Cleanth Brooks, who insisted that the only thing that mattered about a literary work was its formal elements, the words on the page; anything outside the closed system of the text\u2014an author's intention or biography, historical context\u2014was considered irrelevant to an understanding of the work. \"Anything too passionate or conceptual was considered from crude to criminal,\" Acker said. That November, an alternative suggested itself, when Allen Ginsberg visited the campus with Peter Orlovsky and Gregory Corso. Kathy and Gould joined five hundred other students and faculty crowded into Schwartz Auditorium to hear Ginsberg read the entirety of Kaddish, his 1961 masterpiece about his late mother. It was a historic event\u2014Atlantic Records recorded the reading and released it the next year\u2014though Acker would further embellish it in a portrait of Ginsberg she wrote decades later: \"I remember that they walked on to a huge auditorium floor, dressed only in towels. I don't remember what either Allen or Peter said or read. I remember that one of them gave the other a blowjob.\" In fact, Ginsberg and Orlovsky were wearing Indian robes and, on stage anyway, there were no blowjobs. Many years later, Acker and Ginsberg became friendly, would in fact perform together, and that evening at Brandeis, she said, taught her more about poetry than any of her previous academic training: \"I learned that poetry's only rule is that it is not about, it is joy. Poetry is all the treasures, the wonders that I believe sailors see and touch. Equal to and more than the pleasures of the flesh. That night I learned that all the dried-up professors in their dusty schoolrooms, whatever they taught, something about being a success in this culture, didn't begin to teach poetry.\" Kathy constantly surprised Gould with the vehemence of her emotions, and several moments with her left him with lasting memories. On a trip to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, for instance, the couple discovered in a quiet upper wing a reproduction of a tiny medieval Christian chapel room. Gregorian chants echoed from speakers around the space. Then, as Gould leaned in to inspect the frescoes, Kathy suddenly fell to her knees and started sobbing. \"I want to be a nun!\" she cried. \"That's what I should be!\" Gould was baffled at the time, but thinking about it later, deduced that Kathy had a very specific and romantic kind of nun in mind: a teenaged Spanish fourteenth-century beauty, forced into the convent by her father, separated from her young lover, and alternating between self-flagellation and masturbation. Kathy, he realized, was very capable of anesthetizing suffering. She was also good at taking on, or channeling, different personae. A couple months after they'd been dating, he watched and listened as she called a well-known birth control doctor in midtown Manhattan to make an appointment. Her voice changed immediately, becoming, he remembered, \"wealthier, older.\" They took the train to the city and dropped by her family's apartment, where Gould met Claire. They didn't stay long\u2014not even long enough for Gould to form an impression of Claire\u2014and traveled uptown to crash with a friend of Gould's, a Columbia student who left them alone for the night. Though clearly a product of the burgeoning counterculture, Acker was often ambivalent about it. In later life, she frequently pointed out hippie hypocrisies\u2014that \"free love\" was largely exclusive to men, that class differences went unacknowledged, that their utopias were often grounded in retreat and separatism. Later, she denied even being part of that generation: \"The Hippies were our parents,\" she wrote. \"Our parents had had the good life and had taken too many drugs and we, their children, were abortions, mutilation. The Hippies had believed in LOVE and PEACE and we, their children, were mentally and physically misshapen.\" But Kathy did revel in the era's anti-authoritarianism, and a so-called sexual revolution that, for all of its inadequacies, did unhitch sex from reproduction, did make birth control more accessible and abortion legal, did make divorce and homosexuality more broadly acceptable. When she arrived at Brandeis, Kathy said, \"it was cool to fuck because that was the beginning of the hippie days.\" She described \"prowling\" with her girlfriends for men, sharing boyfriends, even keeping a chart that detailed the sizes of her lovers' penises. \"We were really into sex!\" she said. Kathy no longer went by the nickname Cassandra, but several Brandeis classmates did refer to her as \"Lusty Kathy.\" She hung out with older students, theater majors who tricked out their dorms like opium dens\u2014mattresses covering the floors, black curtains\u2014and held orgies. To Gould's chagrin, she also became friendly with a junior named Robert Acker, known as Bob. Acker was a history major from Queens, an intense, intelligent, volatile figure who, along with a few other students, had been busted for pot possession a couple years earlier and temporarily banished from Brandeis. To Gould, he looked like a menacing, skulking jackal, a character straight out of Zap Comix. By some, likely exaggerated, accounts, he exclusively ate steak tartare, studied in the library shirtless, and challenged townies to fights. Kathy's roommate, Tamar Diesendruck, recalled him once abruptly kicking Diesendruck in the groin, for some now forgotten slight. But Kathy adored his outlaw aura. In February, when Gould left campus to spend a weekend with an uncle in Connecticut, she promptly slept with Acker. He found her \"smart\" and \"with all the guts in the world,\" but he was, by no means, as smitten as Gould was. Foreshadowing a persistent issue throughout Kathy's life, his interest was almost purely physical. \"She was cute as pie,\" Acker said many years later. \"But it was not the case of two hearts beating as one.\" Gould was wounded by Kathy's infidelity, but their romance nonetheless trundled along. By the summer, they were living together in Boston, where Gould was house-sitting for a professor while working full-time at the Peace Corps' language lab on the Brandeis campus. Kathy, meanwhile, spent her days writing and reading. Every day, Gould would bring her five or six books from the library, and the next day she'd ask for more. On Saturday afternoons, they bought cheap vegetables, chicken parts for soup, and Spanish wine. It all felt very grown-up, but nonetheless, once a week, they had to drive to Cambridge to receive a call from Claire because Kathy had told her she was living there and looking for a job. Though Gould didn't recall what Claire and Kathy discussed, the conversations were evidently painful\u2014afterward, Kathy would collapse into his arms, sobbing. Gould was in love with Kathy, but he was also intent on becoming a writer. And becoming a writer, he felt, meant going to Europe and leaving her, temporarily, behind. In the fall of 1965, he went on an exchange to Scotland. Kathy, in turn, went back to Acker, who received her, more or less, with open arms. Months later, filled with regret for leaving her behind, Gould contemplated breaking off his trip and returning early. But Kathy had already moved on and quickly nipped this in the bud in a letter to Gould that was flush with characteristic melodrama:\n            About your coming home\u2014please please do not. It is a form of madness\u2014madness that is fr. the gods\u2014as is love, & pain, & the woods. But then we must live separated from the gods, & problems that sent you to Scotland will rouse themselves if you come home. The pendulum has swung: away from myself to your parents, your rightful ambition, your education, your need of geography other than Brandeis. Now I appear in the light of joy. But do you want to marry me now? Is your need and/or fear that powerful? For that is what shall happen\u2014or what reason for an early return? She was right\u2014Gould wasn't ready to get married. Acker, however, was. He was about to graduate and move across the country. Brandeis had refused to renew Marcuse's contract, and the professor was decamping for the University of California at San Diego.I Several grad students planned to go with him, and Acker followed those students' lead.II Acker was still somewhat ambivalent about Kathy, but he also didn't want to lose her. As she would soon learn, he was more neurotic than desperado, more conventional than not. \"I was a little scared,\" Acker said. \"Not of her but of sex in general. People were getting abortions, people were committing suicide or trying to, people were going a little nuts. I hadn't been dinged yet but I thought, now I'm twenty, it's time to retire. Let's settle down.\" In a notebook a couple years later, Kathy would echo Acker's feelings: \"We both needed someone to hang on to for life because we were scared and made schizoid.\" If they married, she could come to the West Coast with him. Kathy had never dreamed of becoming anyone's wife, but California was exotic and new, and she would be even further away from her family. It seemed like a worthwhile gamble. Bud and Claire weren't especially happy about it. She was too young, they thought. They didn't want her to drop out of Brandeis. And who was Bob Acker anyway? What were his prospects? His mother was just a housewife, his father only a contractor for large construction projects in New York. Where was the money, the status? Acker was, Kathy would later say in interviews, a \"Polish Jew,\" and her parents, being \"high-German Jews\" were appalled that she would consort with someone they considered so low-class. \"They thought marrying a Polish Jew was the worst thing you could do,\" she said. The antipathy went both ways\u2014Acker, who met the family only a couple of times, called Claire a \"bitch on wheels.\" Confusingly, many years later, Kathy told an interviewer that her parents wouldn't pay for her schooling unless she got married. It's unclear, however, if they ever paid for her schooling at all, and most likely her grandmother did. She also said that she didn't want to get married, arguing that \"I was a certain class and color. There were so many alternatives.\" In any event, her parents' disdain did make Acker more alluring to her. In her 1984 novel My Death My Life by Pier Paolo Pasolini, she sketches a scene in which \"Kathy\" tells her parents that she's going to get married. They immediately assume she's pregnant and say they can help her get an abortion. She's indignant: \"There are other reasons to get married!\" \"You might as well tell us if you're in trouble,\" her father says. Kathy responds by thrusting her scar-covered wrist in their faces. \"Yeah, I'm in trouble,\" she says. Her parents recoil. Acker's narrator continues: \"Each time I slice the blade through my wrist I'm finally able to act out war. You call it my masochism because you're trying to keep your power over me, but you're not going to anymore. This is the beginning of childhood.\" In other words, marrying Acker was a way to start over. Maybe she could leave her childhood behind. She could create a family of her own, a better or at least a less oppressive one. \"I was trying to get rid of my parents in my mind and feelings,\" she wrote in a notebook a half decade later, \"and to have the calmness to do what I wanted.\" On September 4, 1966, the couple married at a simple ceremony at Florrie's summer house in Atlantic Beach. In one of the three photographs of the wedding that survive, Kathy looks unusually demure in white dress and veil, tanned and fresh-faced, with blunt bangs. But there's also the hint of a coy smile\u2014at last, she's about to be someone other than Kathy Alexander. When he heard the news of their marriage, Gould was crestfallen. He and Kathy had never really broken up, had never said goodbye. About three-and-a-half years later, he tracked the couple down in San Diego and showed up on their doorstep, stoned, looking for closure. He talked to Kathy for an hour, but the moment was thoroughly disappointing. She was frosty, and Gould discovered, to his surprise, that his own intense feelings had likewise cooled with time. She would always be his first love, however, and he'd always remember her with great fondness. A few months later, he moved into a commune in rural Vermont where he wrote his first novel, a back-to-the-land fantasy called Burnt Toast. In it, the narrator, an aspiring poet named Silent, takes a lover named Kathy. In the scene in which she's introduced, Kathy is kneeling on a kitchen floor, looking at a raisin pie in the oven: \"She was undressed, facing away from me, on her knees before the stove; the back and the top of her beautiful thighs were what I saw first, coming into the kitchen, and now that I was close to her I watched her breasts swing in the orange light of the fire (and the fire-shadow of her breasts on the thighs), her glistening lips, her white hands on the iron poker.\" Kathy's voluptuousness still clearly captured Gould's young imagination, the orange light he describes recalling that first night they spent together. But the simplistic fantasy he conjured, that of the hippie earth mother, was one that she would never fulfill for anybody, and indeed, one that she would furiously reject. \"I was turning around and going to the past,\" Gould said, of the different paths their lives took. \"And she was plunging headfirst into the future. She was already launched in directions that I could barely understand or predict.\" I. Several students, and the school newspaper, the Justice, maintained that Marcuse had been fired for his radical views. Abram Sachar argued that Marcuse's departure was much more innocuous. Retirement at Brandeis was mandatory at age seventy. In 1965, Marcuse was almost sixty-eight and had been offered a three-year appointment at UCSD. He chose the longer contract in San Diego so he could get an additional year of active teaching. II. Kathy and others later promoted the story that it was she who had followed Marcuse to UCSD, but in fact, she never took a class with him at either Brandeis or San Diego. Acker himself knew Marcuse and his grad student adherents, but, mainly because of scheduling, he had never studied with the philosopher either. UCSD was attractive to Acker not because of Marcuse but because it was cheap, easy to get into, and he simply wanted a school to hole up in, as he put it, \"until the Vietnam War blew over.\" ",
  "8": "THE NEWLYWEDS IMMEDIATELY HEADED STRAIGHT to San Diego. Acker started grad school and Kathy continued her undergraduate studies, now in the literature department since UCSD didn't offer classics per se. Tuition in California was \"half-nothing,\" as Acker put it, \"and the faucet was open.\" The war in Vietnam was still on and he was happy to wait it out studying by the ocean. They found a cheap, two-story bungalow in Del Mar, a beach town on the northern edge of the city. UCSD was only officially six years old by then, with close to six hundred students and 150 faculty members. Located in the hilly, affluent seaside neighborhood of La Jolla, about fifteen miles north of downtown San Diego, it had been established as one of the world's preeminent scientific research institutions, with an emphasis on oceanography. But the school's fine arts and humanities departments also grew quickly, and its philosophy department became the school's first functioning non-science graduate program. Over the next few years, a number of cultural pioneers would become instructors there: the conceptual artists John Baldessari and Allan Kaprow (creator of the \"Happening\"), the composer Pauline Oliveros (who, infamously, taught courses in Tarot and Indian cooking out of her home), and the iconoclastic film critic and painter Manny Farber. Marcuse settled in relatively well. The poet David Antin, who arrived that same year, remembered him as a \"sparkling and provocative figure in the philosophy department,\" who would wander down La Jolla Boulevard with his hands behind his back like \"he was in some beautiful German city peering longingly into bakery windows.\" He would walk down La Jolla because it was the only street; there were no real streets in San Diego, or at least no street life. On the one hand, it could feel like the Wild West, but it was also a dull, homogenous, racist, deeply conservative city. Marcuse received at least one death threat from the Ku Klux Klan in 1968, and later, under pressure from the likes of the John Birch Society, the school's chancellor would try to force him out by introducing an arbitrary mandatory retirement policy. When Marcuse lured his best-known student, Angela Davis, out to UCSD for grad school, she recalled that when she first arrived, \"it was weeks before I even saw another Black person.\" Bob Acker remembered being on a Greyhound bus, commuting to La Jolla, when news of Martin Luther King's assassination was announced; his fellow passengers erupted in joy. \"San Diego was not only the furthest westmost place in the country,\" Antin said, \"it was also the furthest rightmost place in the country.\" But the overall political atmosphere of the place didn't often intrude on the Ackers' respective consciousnesses. Physically, at least, it was a beautiful and comfortable place to live. Any culture shock they might have experienced was softened by a cocoon that they formed around themselves. \"It was delightful,\" Acker said. \"I was in the water, out of the water, in the water. The air temperature was always seventy degrees, the water temperature was always seventy degrees.\" Acker made about three hundred dollars a month as a teaching assistant, more than enough to cover their expenses. Once Kathy married, her parents more or less stopped supporting her, and she supplemented Acker's income with small grants and what little she could make as an occasional TA herself. When they weren't at the beach, they hung out with Acker's fellow grad students, swimming, studying, partying. He and Kathy played cards, Go, chess. She was very good at chess and would play seriously for the rest of her life. Kathy was somewhat less enamored of San Diego than Acker was. In a 1989 essay, \"Blue Valentine,\" she recalled those SoCal days with bitterness: \"I hated it. My life. The hippy years had begun when I had still been at Brandeis University near Boston and they were now into full swing. People around me believed that they and hopefully all other people could and would only feel only peace and love. Women wore granny dresses, became pregnant, and cooked healthy food. I felt isolated in this world, as if I was pitch black and everyone else, pastel.\" Reading this essay for the first time, decades after Kathy's death, Acker accused her of an almost embarrassing level of embellishment\u2014\"her life fictionalized by her literary persona,\" as he put it. But he acknowledged that she was indeed far from happy at the time. Almost as soon as the Ackers arrived in San Diego, it was clear that the marriage was a mistake. They were probably too young, and their interests had never really aligned\u2014Acker was a student of history, economics, and military diplomacy, while Kathy was almost exclusively interested in literature. Acker wasn't particularly fond of the poetry Kathy was writing either. Forty years later, he remembered it only as \"nice\" and \"not really tasteful,\" and she, in turn, was dismissive of his feedback. \"I'd listen to it, and every now and then I'd give her a suggestion,\" he said. \"She'd give me this look\u2014like, why don't you stick to things you know about?\" Neither, it seemed, had the emotional maturity necessary for a conventional marriage. To make matters worse, both of them were prone to debilitating anxiety attacks, which they referred to as \"the hole in the head.\" Acker would often disappear into a depressive funk that left him unable to do anything but play solitaire for days on end\u2014behavior that Kathy coldly captured in the first paragraph of her novel Rip-off Red: \"\u2026 I got bored doing that Ph.D. shit and being frustrated professors' straight-A pet, especially being faithful to a husband who spent all his time in bed dealing out poker hands\u2026\" Kathy could play the hippie homemaker\u2014she baked bread, sewed her own miniskirts\u2014but wasn't capable of, and had no interest in, being Acker's caretaker. \"She expected me to be the leader of the pack, the head wolf,\" he said. \"She didn't want to be my mom.\" Nor did she want to be, as she put it in a later notebook, \"a permanent Acker cock worshiper.\" Kathy struggled from time to time with her own bouts of depression, even self-harm\u2014at Brandeis, and possibly earlier, she occasionally cut herself. In the notebooks she kept a couple years later, she often referred to \"the angels,\" which sometimes appear to be guardian angels but more often represent an ineffable, malevolent force that eluded description: \"When I speak about angels I mean that there are many ways we experience we don't have language for most of them.\" The angels could play havoc with her emotions and behavior, their presence a particular form of torture: \"the angels are making me into a distortion pulling out my eyes destroying my brains.\" Kathy often spent whole days in the house, never getting out of her silk bathrobe. She was hardly idle, though. She read incessantly, kept writing poetry, and still made it to classes, where she continued to impress her teachers. She took courses in the philosophy department, and English courses with a sweet, Anglophilic Austen scholar named Andrew Wright, who later told people of Kathy that he \"had never seen anything like her\u2014intellectually and every other way.\" She dedicated one poem from those years, \"Ode to Beautiful Women #2\"\u2014part of an unpublished manuscript titled The Golden Woman\u2014to Wright. It's the poems that surround it, however\u2014\"Ode to Beautiful Women #1\" and \"Ode to Beautiful Women #3\"\u2014that offer more obvious biographical insight and detail. \"Ode to Beautiful Women #1\" opens with the line \"the imagination doesn't change anything\" and then proceeds to damn, once again, the hollow lives of parents like her own:\n                \n                    \n                        what are we interested in Today we finally broke with our parents the parents all over America taking amphetamine watching T.V. five to ten hours a day drinking two to ten martinis between 5:30 and 10:30 p.m. getting undressed in the dark getting up on weekdays between 7:00 and 7:30 falling asleep at 10:30 in front of the television getting undressed in the dark going out to a Chinese restaurant run by a Jew from Long Island going to a French restaurant and eating Chateaubriand playing canasta the men playing gin rummy playing bridge with the girls [\u2026]  \"Ode to Beautiful Women #3,\" meanwhile, is a more confessional, sexually explicit, and aggressive cri de coeur. It was a hint of the direction that Kathy's work would soon take but also of her incipient desire for extracurricular romance:\n                \n                    \n                        I want to fuck you in a bed at night hold my legs open while you move into around in me I want to be alone with you I'm sick of shit I don't want you once a week I want to eat with you work/ while you're working I want to be with you David's giving a reading anybody's (friends') giving a reading what sort of communism is this I want you I'm sick of you wearing clothes sitting around in your office/ your house pretending I don't know you I'm sick of thinking about you and you're not here I'm sick of knowing it's impossible knowing that is not our poem it's the poem of an old cliche when beautiful women returning through our desire  In June 1967, the Ackers moved downtown, into a large, ramshackle six-room Victorian on Front Street that was ridiculously cheap\u2014about $35 a month after they rented out the upstairs to other grad students. But it was also located right next to the highway and under the airport flight path. The interior was painted a kitschy lime green and pink, the kitchen infested with cockroaches, maintenance nonexistent. Bob and Kathy slept on a mattress on the floor, sat on cinder-block stools, ate at a plywood dining table that Acker built himself. But they had separate rooms to use as studies, and they did their own work there, mostly in isolation. The relationship drifted, foundered. They talked theoretically about opening up the marriage but then never even got around to the swinging they thought could save things. The marriage would prove, retrospectively at least, an anomaly in both of their lives. In a notebook a few years later, Kathy dispatched the whole thing thusly: \"Acker too straight me too woo-woo wanting a family a real wife I was a good actress for a year and a half I didn't even have to say that much which was incredible\u2026\" In 1968, everything seemed to change, everywhere. In Vietnam, it was the year of the Tet Offensive and the My Lai Massacre. In April, King was assassinated, and then in June Warhol was shot, and two days later, Robert Kennedy was assassinated. In May, violent student protests engulfed Paris, leading to a workers' revolt that nearly brought down the government. In the American literary world, John Updike released Couples, notable for its unusually explicit sex scenes, and innovative fiction flourished, with Robert Coover, John Barth, and even Andy Warhol publishing major novels during the year. In the New York Times, Martha Weinman Lear coined the term \"second wave feminism.\" By November, Richard Nixon would become the country's thirty-seventh president. Kathy graduated from UCSD that spring, and continued to write. Some of the poems she wrote during the period were propelled by the same violence and sex that animated \"Ode to Beautiful Women #3.\" Others were gentler, like \"Poems for Tamar 6. 7. & 8.,\" addressed to Tamar Diesendruck, her old roommate. This trio of poems swarms with allusions to Diesendruck's piano-playing, her Russian heritage, and Kathy's own biography: \"it's raining all over the world: it's raining/on you and me: it's raining on the bed Acker/won't get out of.\" Others, like \"Pornographic Poems,\" are peopled with yet more real-life figures\u2014Wendy, Mel Freilicher\u2014and oscillate between the oneiric and quotidian, the self-serious and self-parodic (\"the murk of the dead within our fingernails up/the nostrils we have picked memories of beautiful childhoods\"). Kathy obviously often longed for Brandeis, or at least for the friends that she had made there. Then that fall, to her delight and relief, they came to her. In September, Freilicher, Diesendruck, and Jeff Weinstein pulled up outside the house on Front Street. Freilicher and Weinstein had come out to California for grad school, the former at UCSD, the latter at UC Riverside (though a year later he'd transfer to San Diego); Diesendruck had followed a boyfriend out west. The crew crashed on the floor of the Ackers' house, curled up in sleeping bags, for days. Kathy was thrilled to have them there, particularly Freilicher, who had abandoned his psychology studies and was now intent on becoming a writer too. Mere acquaintances at Brandeis, they became best friends in San Diego. A teddy bear with mercurial facial hair, Freilicher was gentle, funny, loyal, generous, self-deprecating. Kathy sometimes called him \"Smelly Belly.\" They considered each other soul mates, bonding over books and boys and their mutual, romantic belief in themselves as misfits. \"For hours, Melvyn and I would listen to Warhol's production of The Velvet Underground,\" Acker later wrote, \"and fantasize about living in a society such as that of Warhol and his friends, a society in which the two of us weren't outcasts.\" When they weren't listening to Nico, they were at midnight screenings of underground films in East San Diego or hanging out on campus at the Anomaly Factory, a water tower that had been converted into a high-tech theater lab. Kathy took a few graduate classes, including a Jonathan Swift seminar with Freilicher, which the two of them spent mostly making each other giggle. Freilicher ended up staying in San Diego permanently, teaching writing at UCSD and publishing cerebral, fizzy books like The Unmaking of Americans and The Encyclopedia of Rebels. Steeped in both literary and labor history, they blend memoir, criticism, and fiction, but wear their erudition lightly: historic personages like Margaret Fuller and Bayard Rustin mingle with the likes of Nancy Drew and Jimmy Olsen. In 1974, Freilicher started an experimental literary magazine, Crawl Out Your Window, which ran for fifteen years and where he published Kathy alongside the likes of Lydia Davis, Rae Armantrout, and Martha Rosler. At Brandeis, Freilicher had participated regularly in student demonstrations, and in San Diego, he became even more of a firebrand. With Weinstein, he joined an antiwar group called the Radical Coalition, and later worked with artists' organizations, staging multimedia shows downtown. \"What was going on,\" Freilicher recalled, \"was the revolution. You'd go to class for two weeks, then you'd strike for two weeks.\" Alternative presses were flourishing, including the San Diego Free Press, whose offices, Freilicher remembered, were sometimes firebombed. SDS members served as Marcuse's bodyguards. Kathy, for her part, continued to remain above the fray. \"She was completely with the program,\" Freilicher said, \"but she wasn't into being at meetings and organizing stuff. She was more concerned with alternative lifestyles, squatters, that kind of thing.\" Freilicher was gay but identified then as bisexual. Weinstein, meanwhile, was openly gay and occasionally taught classes in drag. He recalled, with some disbelief, that Kathy had told him he was the first gay man she had ever known. Even more surprising to him, she often asked him what he thought were na\u00efve questions about his sex life\u2014like, what do men do in bed together? The three of them all picked up a bit of money modeling nude for life-drawing classes. Kathy, Weinstein remembered, loved to take off her clothes. ",
  "9": "\"ALL OF US COME FROM parents,\" Kathy wrote. \"My parents were not my biological parents; they were the poets.\" She was referring to Allen Ginsberg, but she met her true poet-parents, the ones who meant the most to her, and who arguably had the most profound influence on her artistic development, in San Diego. If Kathy had hoped, na\u00efvely, that marrying Acker was the \"beginning of childhood,\" her introduction to David and Eleanor Antin was, at last, the real thing. The Antins were Jews from New York too, and though David was a poet and art critic and Eleanor a visual artist, they would both soon redefine their respective disciplines in various thrilling ways. David was thirty-six, tall, irascible, droll, and, thanks to a youthful case of alopecia, completely hairless. Eleanor, whom everyone called Elly, was three years younger, impish, and provocative. David had attended the City College of New York, where he met and befriended several artists and writers, including Jerome Rothenberg, Robert Kelly, and Elly (then Eleanor Fineman). He wrote criticism and poetry and told his students that writing itself was akin to engineering: \"The technology is language. In order to invent something useful, you have to know what is needed now, but also you have to know the present state of the technology.\" In 1966, he received a master's in linguistics from NYU, and a year later, he served as the curator of Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art, before UCSD hired him as an assistant professor in the visual arts department. At UCSD, he taught critical studies and ran their art gallery. It was a good time to go: Elly thought New York had become dull and stifling, and Southern California seemed ripe with possibility. It was more financially advantageous too\u2014at UCSD, David would get paid twice what he had received at NYU. \"People told me it was a group of scientists standing with an open checkbook under a palm tree,\" he later said. At City College, Elly had majored in creative writing and minored in art, while studying acting and philosophy in her free time, a combination of pursuits that led to a career of uncommon versatility and originality. Though she made paintings, sculpture, performances, and video, her creative shifts and the unclassifiable, capacious work led her, most often, to be labeled a conceptual artist. She thought that contemporary art could, and should, include different modes of personal exploration, fantasy, autobiography (and false autobiography). In a 1974 essay, \"An Autobiography of the Artist as an Autobiographer,\" she called herself \"a post-conceptual artist concerned with the nature of human reality, specifically with the transformational nature of the self.\" Her most renowned early work, Blood of a Poet Box, made between 1965 and 1968, consisted of a wooden specimen box filled with a hundred blood samples taken from poets that she personally knew. Her definition of poet characteristically elastic, the project included samples from her husband, Rothenberg, John Ashbery, Carolee Schneemann, John Cage, Yvonne Rainer, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. She called these blood samples \"portraits,\" and it was a good gag: reworked ready-mades that fused art and literature even as the work interrogated ideas of originality and community. Elly and David married in 1961, and had a son in 1967 who they named Blaise, after the Swiss-French modernist poet Blaise Cendrars. In late May 1968, they drove across the country to arrive in California on June 8, a few days after Robert Kennedy was shot. They settled in San Diego's then depopulated northern outskirts, moving into a shabby, stucco-and-tile house in Solana Beach, on a bluff a hundred feet above the Pacific. From their terrace, they could watch whales and listen to coyotes. At UCSD, David taught courses on modern art, early Christian art, performance art, and a course called Strategies of Art-Making. \"He was frighteningly intelligent,\" recalled one student, the artist Robert Kushner. Because he'd published a couple books of poetry, David was also asked to teach a course on the subject. But he had never taught poetry before, and was somewhat dismayed to find that virtually all his students produced \"late adolescent expressionist poems.\" Kathy's work was a bit different, he said\u2014\"verbally more complex\"\u2014but nonetheless he soon recognized a basic and common problem. Young writers, he said, always have to confront the fact that previous generations of writers have almost always beat them to the punch. That is, if they want to write about something, anything really, another writer has already done so. So he gave his students an assignment: they could write about anything they wanted, but first they needed to go to the library and find out if someone else had written about that subject already. Once they did that research and found those books, they could steal from them whatever they wanted. If they wanted to write about desert adventure, say, they could steal something from T. E. Lawrence. The work, David said, would be in putting those disparate pieces together. Within a month, David said, his students were combining Aeschylus with plumbing manuals, and creating \"these wonderful, quickly shifting things,\" like race car drivers changing gears. It was an unusual idea, maybe, when it came to poetry, but hardly new to anyone conversant with American visual art of the day. Artists as different as Joseph Cornell, Robert Rauschenberg, Bruce Conner, and Ray Johnson, to name just a few, had brilliantly used found (and sometimes copyrighted) materials to produce sculptures, paintings, and collages. Antin elucidated this thinking in the poem, \"What It Means to Be Avant-Garde\":\n            and if you have to invent something new to do the work at hand you will but not if you have a ready-made that will work and is close at hand and you want to get on with the rest of the business then youll pick up the tool thats there a tool that somebody else has made that will work and youll lean on it and feel grateful when its good to you for somebody elses work and youll think of him as a friend who would borrow as freely from you if he thought of it or needed to because there is a community of artists who don't recognize copyrights and patents or shouldnt except under unusual circumstances who send each other tools in the mail or exchange them in conversation in a bar Kathy would metabolize these lessons, and soon, famously, make them her own. She didn't technically enroll in any of David's classes, but she did audit them, and, at one point, told Freilicher that she was \"apprenticing\" herself to him. UCSD was new and small, and in some cases, instructors were barely older than the students they were teaching. Relationships formed easily, and both Kathy and Freilicher quickly became close to the Antins. They babysat for Blaise, went to faculty parties at their house in Solana Beach. Later, David would bring conceptual artists like Lawrence Weiner, Joseph Kosuth, and Dan Graham, for shows or to make new work in San Diego. As Kathy had done with Sitney and the New York filmmakers, she soaked it all up. In 1969, the Fluxus artist Alison Knowles brought her installation The Big Book to UCSD. The Big Book was an eight-foot-tall \"book,\" constructed from vinyl, wood, and metal, with pages on casters depicting an apartment complete with a stove, telephone, toilet, art gallery, books, and \"other necessities of life.\" Viewers could move the pages but also move around and between them. Kathy was delighted by this literalization of literature's unending promise, of life as a book and a book as life: \"I thought this is what a book should be,\" she later said. \"It's so many pages and in all these pages everything can take place. It's the open realm of possibilities.\" Kathy became so devoted to David that, for a brief moment, Freilicher worried they were having an affair. They weren't. David only ever thought of her as a kid sister or, even, occasionally, a daughter. \"Elly and I were both very fond of her,\" he said. \"She was a very charming person, very lively. She was very interested in new experiences. She was looking for liberation.\" That seeking, David felt, stemmed from a kind of distress in her, a woundedness. Elly, for her part, found Kathy \"childlike, cuddly and sweet.\" That was part of her appeal, she said, that \"she really wanted you to love her.\" At some point in 1969, in one of David's classes, Kathy met another poet from New York, named Leonard Neufeld. Known as Lenny, the twenty-five-year-old Neufeld was born in the Bronx, and had also attended Brooklyn College, where he studied linguistics and met Antin and Jerome Rothenberg. Around the same time as the Antins, he and his wife, the artist Martha Rosler, and their young son, had moved out to San Diego, where Rosler did her MFA at UCSD and Neufeld pursued a PhD. Neufeld was rail-thin, with long, kinky hair and a somewhat effete effect\u2014in many ways, Bob Acker's opposite. Freilicher didn't much like Neufeld\u2014he thought he was passive-aggressive and manipulative\u2014but Kathy was immediately drawn to him. Neufeld was similarly infatuated. \"She was very attractive,\" he said. \"Physically, intellectually, very up and enthusiastic.\" Neufeld was hardly a faithful husband, and he and Rosler had split up and come back together a couple of times already. When an opportunity presented itself, a few weeks after he and Kathy first met, they slept together. Neufeld thought Kathy's interest in him stemmed largely from his proximity to David and Rothenberg, whom she didn't yet know but whose work in ethnopoetics\u2014which argued that the true roots of modern, experimental poetry were in ancient and indigenous cultures\u2014she found compelling. This may have been true\u2014her affection for Neufeld was erratic from the outset. She had little interest in exchanging one dissatisfying romantic relationship for another. But Neufeld, like so many of her other lovers, was also a conduit to a subculture and community that she wanted to learn about and become part of. By now, Kathy's own marriage was teetering on collapse, and the affair only accelerated things. \"As she got closer to the Antins,\" Bob Acker remembered, \"she and I went further apart. She was simply going places that I wasn't following at all.\" Acker was hardly surprised that Kathy and Neufeld had hooked up, and, in fact, considered it a blessing in disguise. He had become convinced that their situation was \"poison,\" and, still suffering from the paranoia that made him marry her in the first place, he was increasingly nervous that she would somehow \"go off the rails,\" from drugs, depression, or something else. Never mind that Kathy was never a big drug user, and then only pot, speed, and the occasional tab of acid. Soon, Acker moved out, and Neufeld, more or less, moved in. Kathy and Acker separated, and, a couple years later, officially divorced. Neither regretted the decision. \"If I thought about it at all,\" Acker remembered, \"I guess I felt checkmated. I didn't know what course of action had any promise.\" He quickly moved on, eventually becoming an attorney and staying in touch with Kathy only intermittently. In the early seventies, he went to a reading of hers in downtown Manhattan, and left after twenty minutes. When she sent him copies of her Black Tarantula books, he never bothered to respond. In an interview she gave a year or so before she died, Kathy referred to her first husband only as an \"idiot.\" She kept his last name, however, for the rest of her life. \"Looking back on those days,\" Acker said, \"the only surprising thing was that she and I had gotten together in the first place. When the suburban San Diego marriage broke up, she went back to New York and resumed her natural bent.\" ",
  "10": "BY THE SPRING OF 1970, Kathy Acker was twenty-three,I and she had more or less lost interest in academia. \"Dead men I don't want to be dead that way write a thesis on the Aristotelian 'e' flattery and pretending I'm whoever Prof. Garble wants me to be,\" she wrote. She was, however, much more serious about her poetry. All she wanted to do was write. She wanted to be surrounded by fellow writers, wanted to be taken seriously, and wanted to make serious, important work, even if she wasn't exactly sure what shape that work should take. While her relationships with the Antins, Freilicher, and Weinstein were rich and helpful, San Diego itself had started to feel too provincial and isolated. Neufeld, for his part, was floundering a bit, unable to settle on a dissertation topic, uncertain what direction his career should go in. But he still had an apartment back in Manhattan. The rent wasn't bad\u2014a hundred bucks a month\u2014and, more importantly, it was a floor above the apartment that the poet Jerome Rothenberg lived in with his wife, Diane. Maybe they should move back home? To Kathy, of course, home had never signified safety, success, or comfort, but this would be different\u2014it would be the first time living in the city without her family. It would be the first time living in the city as a practicing poet. Even if she wasn't completely sure about Neufeld, or didn't know what either of them would do for money, it seemed like the right way to go. They packed their bags. The apartment was at 600 West 163rd Street, at Broadway just south of Washington Heights. It was a big place on the sixth floor, with five rooms that, soon after they moved in, they repainted bordello colors: the main bedroom a coral orange with large violet stars, the living room a deep crimson. They liberated some mismatched furniture from a friend's basement, filled the apartment with books. The New York City that they returned to, especially compared to slow, placid Southern California, was a forbidding interzone, at once wild and filthy, depopulated yet loud. The city was nearing bankruptcy, and, as with other big American cities, increasing numbers of middle-class residents were fleeing to the suburbs in search of employment. Danger seemed to be everywhere: on the subway, in the parks, on your fire escape, inside your apartment. Between 1966 and 1971, the number of reported robberies almost tripled. In 1972, almost 1,700 New Yorkers were murdered\u2014four times the number that had been killed less than a decade previously. The political unrest that continued to engulf the country was also, of course, present in the country's largest city: just a couple months earlier, a nail bomb in a Greenwich Village townhouse had exploded, killing three bomb makers, all members of the Weather Underground. For Acker, the city's chaos mirrored the uncertainty of her own life. \"Days and days of anxiety each day,\" she wrote in a notebook from the period. \"I hear only accounts of the collapse of the city through breaking pipes graft viciousness.\" But New York was also, famously, in the midst of unprecedented artistic ferment. Manufacturing had collapsed and real estate had flatlined, but that also meant it was impossibly cheap to live there. \"One could live an interesting existence on four hundred dollars a month,\" said the artist Duncan Hannah, who moved to the city in 1973 and would become a casual friend of Acker's a few years later. Budding painters, dancers, playwrights, musicians, filmmakers\u2014especially avant-garde aspirants with little to lose and far more to gain\u2014arrived in droves. The cultural world, or at least the one that mattered to Acker, was small but concentrated, intimate, and, above all, accessible. Warhol reigned. The Velvet Underground played their last shows at Max's Kansas City in 1970, and, in their wake, rock music took on new, unexpected forms: there was Patti Smith, the New York Dolls, Iggy Pop, Television, to name just the most famous. And not just rock\u2014over the next handful of years, New York was the epicenter of loft jazz, classical minimalism, hip-hop, disco, salsa. Just a couple years prior, Ellen Willis had become the New Yorker's first pop music writer, and in 1970, her cofounder of the radical feminist group Redstockings, Shulamith Firestone, published the groundbreaking The Dialectic of Sex. Kate Millett released Sexual Politics. That same year, Film Forum and Anthology Film Archives\u2014run by P. Adams Sitney\u2014both opened. The Stonewall riots a year earlier spawned a gay liberation movement. In SoHo, George Maciunas formed the first artists' co-ops. Six years after Sitney had introduced her to some of these worlds, Acker took tentative steps back into them. She took dance classes with Meredith Monk, gobbled up Maya Deren movies. She and Neufeld got a pair of cats, Paul and Elizabeth, which she doted on. She went through a macrobiotic phase, and they sometimes ate at Paradox, on the Lower East Side, where you could get a bowl of rice and vegetables for a dollar. But mostly, Acker holed up in the apartment, writing, reading (among others during this period: Virginia Woolf, Henry Miller, Colette, Ana\u00efs Nin, Burroughs, Paul Bowles, Joe Brainard), sleeping, and having sex with Neufeld. Acker had been a relatively impoverished student in San Diego, but in New York, things immediately felt more financially desperate. She didn't want to depend on Neufeld, nor could she anyway\u2014on top of the rent they split, Neufeld was paying $100 a month in child support and another $20 a month to a divorce lawyer. He was broke too. But Acker had never really held a nine-to-five job, and she wasn't about to start now, no matter how difficult things were. \"\u2026 a job to me means adjustment the acceptance into the real reality I'm one of the unfits\u2026,\" she wrote in a notebook. This was at once admirable and adolescent. On one level, Acker had an undeniable sense of entitlement, and the privilege of someone who, up to that point, had never needed to work. On another, more interesting, level, she also possessed a persistent contempt for the conformity of the workaday world and an already unshakeable devotion to her art. A job was subservience and self-annihilation. Writing was work, to be sure, but it wasn't labor, it was thinking, play, make-believe, magic. Eventually, in terms of \"straight\" jobs, she would pick up part-time secretarial work and model for art classes, but she would never take anything that really disrupted the writing life she was trying to build\u2014one that, for all of its precarity and uncertainty, provided at least a satisfying degree of autonomy. \"I've spent the last four years of my life deciding the way in which I get money by refusing to do anything that would not let me over-sleep,\" she wrote, deadpan. Neufeld didn't want to work either, or even really write that much; at twenty-seven, his greatest enthusiasm was reserved for sex. The libidinous freedom that Neufeld and Acker had granted each other in San Diego continued in Manhattan, and they both took advantage of it, though Neufeld far more frequently, and with far less anxious ardor. While Acker would have flings with various men and women and insisted on at least her right to promiscuity (\"I must at all times have the same freedom a man would have,\" she wrote), sex had started to become extremely painful for her. Within weeks of arriving in New York, she was diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a chronic infection of the reproductive system that's often a complication of chlamydia and gonorrhea. She sometimes dulled the pain with synthetic opium and Nembutal (medication that required yet more money), but the infection would persist for several years. \"I was very sick,\" she later wrote a friend. \"I had almost died.\" In a manuscript titled Poems 5/71\u20136/71, a single paragraph summarizes both her horrific health problems and the grim care she received (or didn't receive):\n            I'm hemorraghing again today a week now Lenny fucked me last night I might have had a cyst that broke some doctor's talking about a health plan based on a desire for life and for the saving of life which no one in this country's going to want my right side now hurts around the ovary and I've almost fainted three times today in the last year every organ in my abdomen has been infected I had been told to take ampicillin by a richy doctor and fucked my intestines up a month ago started taking birth control pills again I immediately got a breast infection only nursing mothers are supposed to get then the hemorraghing the so-called doctor says no reason to stop taking the pills Lenny calls up why don't you call a doctor so I can get fucked up some more: stories about the death of the poor When Acker reached out to Claire for help, financial or otherwise, she claimed that Claire rebuffed her every time. In a notebook, Acker writes that she called one day, convinced she was dying, and Claire told her that \"the city will pay for your grave.\" Neufeld's affairs could sometimes be agonizing to Acker, but she was more worried, it seemed, about her own ambivalent feelings toward him. Did she really love him, or was she just using him? Acker was terrified of becoming like Claire, trapped by economic necessity in a loveless relationship, and made crueler and more hostile for it. At some point, and to Neufeld's displeasure, she cut her hair into the quasi buzz-cut she would keep (with obsessive stylistic variation) for the rest of her life. It was obviously a small way to assert some agency over her own body and appearance and a denial of feminine beauty standards of the day. But ironically\u2014or intentionally?\u2014the style made her look even more like her mother. At the same time, Acker fretted, in frequent bouts of self-loathing, about Neufeld's feelings for her. On page 64 of one of her notebooks (undated but likely from 1971), she wrote the sentence \"do you love me\" eight times over. It was a question she asked of many people in her life. Contact with her family remained infrequent and frustrating. According to Acker, they refused to give her money to pay for her medication (\"they pissed on me when I was sick\"). When Bud had a heart attack, Claire told Acker that she had caused it. \"\u2026 I'm going to deal with them by not dealing with them,\" she wrote, \"there are no more parents\u2026\" Nana, for her part, wasn't in Acker's good books either, demanding a certain supplication: \"\u2026 my goddamn grandmother just sent me a valentine's card saying call me I should lick her ass\u2026\" She turned instead to the Rothenbergs, looking, it seemed, for them to fill the parental role the Antins had. Well, at least Jerry. Diane, an anthropologist and writer herself, had little patience for Acker, who she remembered as \"extremely self-absorbed and vain.\" But Jerry thought she was bright, adventurous, and attractive. He hired her and Neufeld to copyedit his anthology of Native American prose, Shaking the Pumpkin, and to serve as model/actors for his artist's book, Esther K. Comes to America (1931). Occasionally, Acker and Neufeld would babysit the Rothenbergs' young son, Matthew. They hung out with the couple's more interesting friends, poets like Jackson Mac Low and Diane Wakoski. The Rothenbergs were about fifteen years older than Acker, and, like the Antins, showed how a couple might make a rich and creative life together. Despite the age difference, Acker often felt attracted to Jerry, even confiding in her notebooks that she was actually in love with and wanted to sleep with him. Though more often, she recognized him as a mentor and, unwilling to upset his marriage, stifled her desire. In one of her notebooks, Diary 1, she writes, \"I don't know how to put down my feelings about Jerry very upset since I speak to few people none as fully as him though that's not fully at the point when I could go closer to someone I feel abstracted scared? I feel like I've been to bed with Jerry it's stupid to pretend that's fantasy because it's literal truth (though not now).\" After the Rothenbergs left New York for San Diego in January 1971, Acker sent these pages to Jerry, with an accompanying letter that contained a half-hearted apology\u2014\"please excuse the personal stuff I should have talked about it to you before this but I didn't know of course I have no intention of publishing or publicizing any of this that could hurt anyone without full permission etc.? do I have such?\" There was also a hint of her growing ambition\u2014in the same letter, she asked if she could use his name as a reference if she submitted the work to the Dial Press. Jerry also brought Acker to the Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery at East 10th and Second Avenue. The Poetry Project, cofounded by the poet and translator Paul Blackburn, was arguably the most significant forum for American poetry in the twentieth century. St. Mark's Church had a long history of social activism and support for the arts. Throughout the 1960s, it was home to free jazz concerts, screenings of banned underground films, and experimental theater workshops. Blackburn read solo at the Project's first official event on September 22, 1966; a month later, Lawrence Ferlinghetti read to an audience of twelve hundred people, with five hundred turned away at the door. The community that gathered at the Project was fractious, incestuous, and eclectic, comprising loose- and tight-knit gangs of poets that would later be labeled Beats, New York School, Deep Image, Black Mountain. At the time, regular participants and audience members comprised a pantheon of innovative American poets: Rothenberg, Diane Wakoski, Robert Creeley, Ted Berrigan, Alice Notley, John Ashbery, Anne Waldman, Charles Bernstein, and Ron Padgett. The Project dissolved the oft-mundane concept of the poetry reading, staging day-long, celebrity-studded marathon events and multimedia bacchanalias like the one John Giorno hosted in 1969, complete with fog and light machines, music, acid-spiked punch, and hundreds of joints. \"The Poetry Project burns like red hot coal in New York's snow,\" Ginsberg said. In Acker's early writing life, it provided a similar heat, as well as regular inspiration and solidarity. It was a place where she developed the early style that characterizes her first published works, where she experimented with and cultivated different voices and registers, where she finally, openly, declared herself a poet in front of people other than her friends and lovers: \"by reading these poems relations of emotions publicly I assert their worth my blood the way in which I live reading them publicly is the complement to this private writing down and is a complete act\u2026\" Sometime in the late 1960s, though probably even earlier, Acker began to keep regular, voluminous notebooks, the contents of which provide the most detailed, sustained account of her early adulthood and first attempts at becoming, if not yet a professional writer, then a serious one. Acker often refers to these notebooks as \"diaries,\" but the word isn't quite apt or sufficient and, indeed, on the cover of at least one notebook, the \"title\" Diary is struck out and replaced with the word Poems, a putatively more capacious category. \"Logs\" might be a better term too, cataloguing as they do the steady formation of Acker's sensibility as a writer. In lined, spiral-bound notebooks of various sizes, in handwriting that is loopy and almost childlike, Acker chronicles the ups and downs of her relationship with Neufeld, other sexual affairs, her half-hearted attempts at employment, gossip about writers, her own fragile mental and physical state, her dreams, her cats, books she's reading, her thoughts on writing, compositional methods, memory, and representation. Even when broke, she usually used, as she would for the rest of her life, a Montblanc fountain pen. For the most part, these entries are rapid, raw, and intimate, a punctuation-free stream of consciousness, where one event or thought suddenly gives way to another, and subjects and subjectivities shift without warning or signpost. Seemingly factual events butt up against, or run headlong into, fantasy and dream. As in her later writing, friends, lovers, and colleagues appear frequently, their names unchanged. It was as if, now definitively and publicly identifying herself as a writer, Acker was either permitting or forcing herself to keep her eyes and hands moving, to keep writing and writing and writing, to get everything down\u2014or out. Did she have a choice? Her consciousness was less stream than geyser or cataract. The scholar Claire Finch describes the notebook entries as \"a succession of gasps.\" Most diaries are pocked with performance, half-truths, and the misdirection of memory, but Acker's notebooks are this and something more\u2014early experiments in the juxtapositions and collage of her later fictions. Acker spelled out her method, to a certain degree, in a 1971 notebook titled DIARY DREAMS II:\n            I want also to be able to put down on the spot how I experience each event even these words make it seem like there's an inside experiencing mechanism and an outside event because I constantly change lie forget the lie was a lie invent on top of that I want a record of the way in which I remember and distort or refind experience through time though that's my private shit since my life can't be this fascinating to anyone else something pleases me about putting trivial incidents down as they happen one by one I don't know what I don't care if I remember properly in fact I remember none of my pre-school childhood\u2026 In another instance, she wrote \"this diary is about the destruction of myself and everyone else I know as the destruction is taking place from day-to-day.\" A few years later, on the cover of another notebook, she scribbled, \"I'm not sure what I'm doing. A messy sloppy account & diary. I try to figure out what I know.\" In a letter to the artist Alan Sondheim, she describes the notebooks as \"my attempt to map at that time my total prsent [sic] consciousness\u2026\" The notebooks were a place to process the tumult of everyday life, but also a kind of laboratory\u2014how could she turn this tumult into writing, into art? She was just beginning to explore how, and why, a self is constructed on the page, and what at first seem to be pages of immediate, confessional musing are in fact a fragmentary, emotionally excessive blend of reportage, dreams, fiction, and memoir. \"Fantasy, sensorial perception, dream mixed,\" she wrote. Soon, she would take chunks of these diaries, some short, some long, rewrite them explicitly as poems, and type them up. Like other female poets of the time\u2014Bernadette Mayer, Anne Waldman, and Alice Notley\u2014all of whom she would soon meet at St. Mark's, she was taking the conversational, quotidian qualities of New York School poetry and giving them an eroticism and sense of duration and perception that were subversive and unabashedly feminine. Acker also gave this formal slipperiness a kind of ontological weight, for the reader of the notebooks the effect can sometimes be simple confusion. Where does reality begin and fantasy end? What makes a dream different from a memory? How does memory produce a self? What is a fact? What is truth? These are questions she would repeatedly ask in her later fiction and, indeed, the errant, indeterminate nature of the events she describes in her notebooks confirms what Acker later argues in her novels: that language is inadequate and truth irreducibly complex and unstable. Binary divisions between fantasy and reality, dream and memory, she maintains, are false, simplistic, and unproductive; all these different things inexorably fold in on each other. For the biographer, though, it means regarding these notebooks, to a certain extent, as enclosed in quotation marks. It means relying on these entries as evidence\u2014of actual events, of Acker's thoughts, desires, and beliefs\u2014only up to a point, and a point that is in constant motion. At the same time, the fact that Acker fills these pages with such banal incidents, and that her observations usually appear deeply personal, suggests that reading these pages as an approximate factual representation is not unwarranted. The young woman that emerges is herself in flux, and appears, by turns and at once, petulant, defiant, earnest, seething, self-sabotaging, fearful, isolated, longing. From time to time, and especially when discussing her cats or her writing, there are eruptions of elation, even ecstasy. She feels too much, doesn't feel enough. She has a difficult time meeting people, she hates people. She loves her body, hates her body. She loves New York, hates New York. In one moment, she is completely convinced of the value of her writing; the next, it's worthless. She craves authenticity while struggling to define what that even means. Above all, she is constantly questioning\u2014what she thinks, what she does, what she writes and feels and remembers and desires. Even as the entries can feel hurried and harried, for Acker, writing seems to be a way to slow down her pain, to snatch at and examine it. There are countless moments in the notebooks that are impossible to authenticate, but many others that, when pressed, release a compelling essence of veracity. In one vivid example, Acker recalls Freilicher and his girlfriend at the time, Wilma Korevaar, visiting New York just before Labor Day of 1971. The two young couples get drunk, ride bikes to Central Park, gossip. It's a welcome visit, but in her notebook, Acker complains about Freilicher being \"in his usual depressed and ambivalent state,\" and then, worse, trying to cajole her and Neufeld into having sex with him and his girlfriend. In her account, Acker bails on the orgy but then, trembling and upset, listens as the three of them have sex in the next room. Decades later, both Neufeld and Freilicher remembered a much different scene. Neufeld claimed that he was never attracted to Freilicher and nothing sexual ever happened between them. Freilicher, for his part, recalled Neufeld nefariously luring everyone, Acker included, onto their waterbed, where they removed their clothes and then, before anything really happened, quickly put them back on. Freilicher distinctly remembers Acker's violent trembling. Korevaar doesn't remember Acker being there at all. In any case, Acker wrote incessantly, filling notebook after notebook throughout 1970 and beyond, later typing up extracts that she called poems. She wrote so much that a tenant on the floor below complained about the incessant clatter of her typewriter. Writing was pleasure, possibility, perversion; she was devoted to it, obsessed with it, addicted to it\u2014\"this writing is getting to be like junk I'm going crazy doing it want more.\" When she wanted to show Freilicher just how much writing meant to her, she drew a circle and said, \"This is the area of freedom\u2014writing.\" Then she'd point outside the circle and say, \"This is the world.\" (She made similar claims in other places, including in her novel I Dreamt I Was a Nymphomaniac!: Imagining: \"This is the realm of complete freedom: I can put down anything.\") But in the pages of these notebooks, \"writing\" and \"the world\" form something more like a Venn diagram\u2014the two overlap, creating something altogether new. Writing, for her, was alchemical, the freedom to rearrange and reimagine the world. Even decades later, in a letter to the film theorist Peter Wollen, another writer and friend, she still held on to her belief in the transformative liberation of writing: \"\u2026 it's only one fucking life one life to do everything to do everything to the hilt. I am stupidly romantic, and writing is one way, no possibility left of hiding lying keeping shut. I don't like being in pain, but I'll take pain any day over prison. Every day what writing for me is my fight against the prison\u2026\" I. Given Bob Acker's almost complete absence from the remainder of this book, \"Acker\" refers to Kathy Acker here and hereafter. ",
  "11": "BRANDEIS, BOB ACKER, AND SAN Diego had allowed Acker to ostensibly shed much of her Sutton Place background. Coming back to New York with Neufeld let her break, for the most part, the new bonds\u2014marriage, the academy\u2014that she'd acquired out in the world. She wanted to go even further. As she put in Rip-off Red, Girl Detective, the novel she'd start working on a couple years later, she was ready to descend \"to the more interesting depths.\" About five months after they had been back, Neufeld came across an ad in the Village Voice, placed by Robert Wolfe Studios, which was looking for actors for pornographic films. Throughout the sixties and seventies, Robert Wolfe, more commonly known as Bob Wolfe, produced thousands of silent, B&W 8mm film loops, so-called fuck films that were shown in peep show booths. The peeps themselves were an innovation pioneered by Wolfe's boss Marty Hodas, a vending machine operator who had the idea in 1966 to outfit old coin-operated movie machines with loops that showed the kind of frontal nudity then commercially unavailable in New York. He then distributed the machines to the rapidly proliferating adult bookstores in Times Square. With Wolfe, Hodas became a zealous producer and distributor of such films himself\u2014he was called \"King of the Peeps\" or \"Lord of the Loops\"\u2014and he began buying up leases on storefronts up and down 42nd Street and Eight Avenue, converting former camera shops and pinball arcades into porn bookstores and peeps. The King of the Peeps was also a loathsome human being\u2014sexist, temperamental, violent. He beat his wife and children so badly that the family dog pissed the floor every time he came into the house. Bankrolled allegedly by the mob, which he consistently denied, Hodas also soon came to own several profitable movie theaters in the Deuce, whose screens he quickly dedicated to hardcore porn. While Wolfe worked with future stars of the industry like Linda Lovelace, his actors were mostly amateurs: young, attractive, horny hippies out to make a quick buck, usually $75 to $100 a film. Neufeld was intrigued by the possibility\u2014\"It felt adventurous and exciting and a way to have more sex,\" he recalled. So was Acker. To her, porn could be performance, material, and experience, all of which would feed her writing. They soon headed down to Wolfe's 14th Street basement studio, which turned out to be a cramped, fetid place furnished only with a stained bed. The films were made mostly at Wolfe's place, but on at least one occasion, Acker and Neufeld shot films for another producer in their own apartment. At the latter, another pal of Rothenberg's, a baby-faced photographer from Long Island named Larry Fink, dropped by to take some pictures. He was a few years older than Neufeld, a disciple of Lisette Model's and a colleague of Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand. While later better known as a society photographer, he'd also have one-man shows of his photojournalistic work at the MoMA and the Whitney. Fink was both attracted and repulsed by the whole scene, and found Acker, in particular, a puzzle: \"My interpretation was that she couldn't feel real emotions,\" he said. \"She was so droll and blas\u00e9 that to me the only way she could feel was to abject herself.\" Fink would later shoot the stills for Rothenberg's Esther K. book and Neufeld got Fink to shoot him and Acker for the cover of his own 1972 poetry book Theory. In that black-and-white image, they look almost like a gender-reversed John Lennon and Yoko Ono\u2014Acker stands in the foreground, her hair cropped, wearing Lennon-like granny glasses and a see-through white shift while Neufeld, his long dark curls framing his face, peeks shyly over her shoulder. \"Everybody had a little vie boh\u00e8me,\" Rothenberg recalled, \"but theirs was a special version of that.\" The couple's porn career didn't last long. Neufeld turned out to be more self-conscious than he'd expected; he often had trouble performing. And for Acker, what was at first a lark soon became something more parlous. \"Kathy was always kvetching,\" remembered Diane Rothenberg, \"complaining how imposed on she was because she had to participate in these sexual things. I remember her telling me she went to an audition at a producer's office without Lenny. And you know how a producer sometimes comes on to an aspiring actress and sometimes the actress runs out of the room? Kathy didn't run out of the room.\" Neufeld's memory of the incident is somewhat different\u2014he said that Acker showed up alone to a shoot where there was no one but a cameraman and that the cameraman told her he was going to have sex with her and film it. While Neufeld maintained that Acker simply didn't appreciate this \"being sprung upon her,\" and was hesitant to say that she was raped, or even forced into the act, Acker detailed a similar scene in her 1982 novel, Great Expectations, which strongly suggests that she was. Toward the end of that book, an Acker alter ego answers a want ad and travels to a West Village basement apartment, where a photographer sexually assaults her. \"While the big man was shoving himself into her,\" Acker writes, \"the girl lay as stiff as a log and wouldn't allow herself to feel any pleasure because this was the main way her fear would allow her to express anger.\" In Acker's notebooks, her disgust for the experience, for the whole porn-making endeavor, in fact, quickly becomes apparent. She writes often of her \"hatred of men.\" She starts having nightmares. She thought she was being followed or stalked. Finally, she just stopped going to the studio.I But sex work was still nonetheless preferable to any number of mind-numbing straight jobs. That December, when Hodas offered Acker and Neufeld the opportunity to perform in a live sex show at Fun City, a magazine shop and theater on 42nd Street, they took it.II They usually did at least six half-hour shows per shift, though they were expected to be on call at the theater for up to fourteen hours. Acker was paid $20 a show. It was more than enough to pay their rent and, more importantly, it gave her the whole week to write.III The theater seated about a hundred men; the audience was always men, and often tourists, each paying $10 to $15 a ticket. The sex was simulated, and Neufeld and Acker devised scenarios and characters around the phony fucking: Neufeld might play Santa Claus and Acker an excited young girl on Christmas morning, or he a therapist and she his randy patient. \"It was my only venture into playwriting,\" Neufeld said. Their \"set\" was a lone chair and a wobbly single bed, covered with a filthy green blanket. Acker often forgot her lines and, with the shows considered on the edge of legality, was constantly afraid of being busted by the cops. Occasionally, to fill time, she would do solo stripteases, listlessly pretending to masturbate or simply opening her legs so audiences could ogle her. Acker was of two (maybe more) minds about the work and often threatened to quit. She described the job in a notebook as \"the lowest way to make the basic bread,\" but also later told an interviewer that she was \"into it,\" adding that \"I don't draw hard categories you know.\" A few years later, in The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula, she returns to these days, in a molten account that flickers between the comic and the contemptuous, horror and hilarity, capturing her overall ambivalence about the job before arriving at its dagger-like final sentence:\n            In one of the acts in my sex show I become a young woman who is talking to a psychiatrist. I tell the psychiatrist how Santa Claus fell out of the chimney told me I should always be a good girl I talk baby talk I should always do what he tells me I slowly start taking off my blouse and rubbing my right hand over my right breast, I have to believe in Santa Claus. Suddenly, as I'm about to kiss my nipple, I stop; I see hundreds of men watching me. I've delusions: men follow me, men want to hurt me, men want to have sexual activities with me without my consent and desire to. The psychiatrist laughs at me. The men who are watching me as I writhe around on the bed start talking to me I joke back with them. The psychiatrist tells me I've hearing delusions; I cut off my hair; I'm Joan of Arc. I lead soldiers in drag and kill everyone. I become hot: I rip off my clothes, I begin to masturbate men make me ooo soo hot. The psychiatrist fucks me we both come five million times. OOOO O yes yes that's it no no? o please o yes o please o come on faster.\u2026 faster give it to me now NOW ooo (low) ooo (higher) oooo oooo oah auahhh oahh. eha. (down again). All my diseases are gone. Around this time, Acker ran into P. Adams Sitney on Broadway. He was now teaching at NYU's new cinema studies department. While Acker referred to him in a notebook as a \"goddamn woman-hating fucker,\" she found herself still attracted to him. Sitney was somewhat surprised to find she was now enthralled with the writers he'd introduced to her as a teenager, but also appalled that she was eager to become part of the New York art scene, which he more or less reviled. She later called him and had him meet her at the apartment. Neufeld was there, but he soon left, and she and Sitney had sex. To Sitney's surprise, however, Neufeld returned shortly after and was eager to join them; Sitney reluctantly agreed. Later, he went to see them both at Fun City, a spectacle he found degrading and pathetic. \"The drama was awful,\" Sitney said, \"the acting phony.\" There was other, more compelling, drama backstage, that Acker was faithfully capturing in her notebooks. In the dressing room, and on breaks when she would grab a table at nearby Tad's steak house or a greasy spoon called Embers, Acker filled page after page with scenes, observations, and dialogue taken from the days and nights at Fun City. Much of this was inspired by her fellow performers, whose lives were more difficult than her own, tawdry and titillating psychodramas replete with hard drugs, crime, and sour romance. One of these performers was a future porn star named Marc Stevens, nicknamed \"10 \u00bd,\" and later photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe.IV She often hung out with him and his boyfriend, Mickey, the couple's frequent spats a regular source of material. She later claimed that Warhol superstar Joe Dallesandro was friends with the guy who cleaned the Fun City peep booths, and that she and her fellow performers were all basically waiting for Warhol to discover them. \"We weren't entirely joking,\" she wrote, \"but we were hoping.\" Acker had also then discovered the pioneering writing experiments\u2014the cut-up, the fold-in\u2014that William Burroughs and Brion Gysin published in the Evergreen Review.V \"All writing is in fact cut-ups,\" Burroughs and Gysin wrote. \"A collage of words read heard overheard. What else? Use of scissors renders the process explicit and subject to extension and variation.\" Following their lead, Acker took the stories she heard at Fun City and collaged them with her own diary and dream material, sometimes transposing these stories to first person. The result, not unlike her notebooks, was jagged, breathless, largely free of punctuation, with Acker shifting swiftly and deliberately from subject to subject, image to image. \"I really love doing cut up like destroying everything and making music of it,\" she later told Bernadette Mayer. For Burroughs, the cut-up and fold-in were means to reveal the codes that construct the world, to, as he famously wrote in Nova Express, \"storm the reality studio\" and \"retake the universe.\" For Acker, they were ways to think against every repression, to overturn the worlds, and words, of parents, gender, the academy, authorship itself. They could subvert the strictures of identity. They could anatomize sexual power. If Burroughs was a satirist, Acker was a kind of metafabulist. Acker loathed the theater on 42nd Street and the men who ran it (\"the shits,\" she called them), but the work and the environment provided what she, retrospectively at least, considered a productive and profitable radicalization. While she was certainly no na\u00eff, up until that point she had been a more or less \"good\" middle-class girl. Now, suddenly, she was not just part of the working class, but a sex worker, surrounded by other sex workers. It was akin, perhaps, to Simone Weil going to the factories. She acquired a new, deeper understanding of capitalism and feminism. Stripped of her own class privilege, so to speak, she was now confronting, every week, the violence of male privilege and the male gaze. If she had only ever been a casual observer of the protests that roiled the campuses at Brandeis and UCSD, here she was fully engag\u00e9e in the sexual revolution, literally putting her body on the line. \"In my life politics don't disappear but take place in my body,\" she would write a few years later in Blood and Guts in High School. In several later interviews, Acker would credit this period in her life with utterly transforming her perception of power in the world:\n            It changed my politics\u2026 the 42nd Street experience made me learn about street politics. It's not that I was that interested in sex. It more gave me a viewpoint of whatever goes on in actuality through the kind of sexual perspective. I think Genet has the same perspective. You see people from the bottom up, and sexual behavior, especially sex minus relationship\u2014which is what happens in 42nd Street\u2014is definitely bottom. Then you see it in a different way, especially power relationships in society. And I think that perspective never left me. This perspective was complex, however. At the same time, she told Sitney, with pride and glee, that she had become a \"whore.\" When not working, she favored short skirts and, occasionally, transparent dresses with nothing underneath. While she was learning up close how sex could be central to female oppression, how it served as a tool of control, she was also taking pleasure in exhibitionism and performance, and in the idea\u2014as staged and debased as it was in this context\u2014that desire could, potentially, be a site of resistance. The tricky, maybe impossible, reconciliation of these things would preoccupy her future writing. In a sense, Acker was slumming. Many years later, those months in the sex industry would continue to establish her bona fides, and remind readers that, no matter how close she skirted to the literary mainstream, once upon a time, she was an up-from-the-streets wild child. In March 1971, as Acker had feared, the vice squad raided the theater. Acker and Neufeld were arrested for public lewdness. They spent a night in jail, with her bosses finally bailing them out. Acker and Neufeld eventually had to appear in court multiple times, and in her notebooks, Acker bristles with equal contempt for Hodas, the lawyers, and the cops, conjuring a conspiracy of profit in which the only losers were her and her fellow workers: \"it's the ass-hole [sic] of the shittiest bureaucracy that will exist we're the ones who sit in the court became criminals if who don't show up for 12 hours each month if we don't take whatever shit anyone decides to hand out\u2026\" Acker would later glamorize criminals and lawlessness in her fiction, but the real-life hoodlums that she worked for were, she knew, hardly romantic figures. As she wrote at the time, \"I admire criminals in my head knowing they're shits businessmen motherfuckers like everyone else.\" I. None of the loops seem to have survived, but a half-dozen years after they were made, the poet Ron Silliman stumbled across one of the films in a San Francisco porn shop. The thing he remembered most about it was a scene in which Acker is flogged\u2014with lettuce leaves. Acker later claimed, half-jokingly, that this was her first experience with S/M. II. That's the name that Acker used or remembered, though the actual name may have actually been the Avon 42nd Street or the Fake; no one really remembers. In a notebook, Acker writes that the theater was the only theater in New York to offer a live sex show, and in his Tales of Times Square, Josh Alan Friedman reports that the first to do so was the less felicitously named Mine-Cine. By which he's probably referring to the Mini Cinema on Seventh Avenue and West 48th Street. III. In a March 1976 interview Acker gave to Only Paper Today, the Toronto art magazine, she said she performed six days a week, but entries in her notebook\u2014\"I'm working in a live sex show for bread it gives me six days of leisure\"\u2014contradict this. IV. Acker usually misspells his name as \"Mark,\" and he was occasionally credited as such in later films he made. V. Acker often credited Burroughs and Gysin's The Third Mind, which collects these experiments in one book, with influencing her early writing. She, in fact, considered The Third Mind Burroughs's most important book. It wasn't published, however, until 1978, long after she'd started publishing. ",
  "12": "A MONTH BEFORE THE BUST, on February 10, Acker and Neufeld went to the Poetry Project to see Patti Smith and Gerard Malanga read. Ever since high school, when she first saw his poetry at the Gotham Book Mart, Acker had idolized Malanga (and fantasized about sleeping with him). She had never heard of Smith. Not many people had. But just a few months older than Acker, she'd already established herself as a rock critic and an emerging, electrifying poet, and was an intimate of two other soon-to-be-titanic cultural figures, Robert Mapplethorpe and Sam Shepard. For Smith's very first public reading, Mapplethorpe had convinced Malanga to let her open for him at St. Mark's, and Smith exploited the opportunity as fully as she could. She tapped an acquaintance at the Chelsea Hotel named Lenny Kaye to punctuate her reading with bursts of electric guitar, the first time the instrument had ever been played in the church. She wanted to perform her poetry, she said, the way she had learned from Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix. February 10 was Bertolt Brecht's birthday, and she opened her performance with a rendition of \"Mack the Knife,\" while also dedicating the reading to \"criminals from Cain to Genet.\" She read from poems like \"Oath,\" whose opening lyric, \"Christ died for somebody's sins/But not mine,\" would also serve as the opening lines, more or less, of \"Gloria,\" the first track on Horses, her debut album four years later. Poets John Giorno and Joe Brainard were in the audience, and, thanks to Malanga, the church was packed with Factory folks: Lou Reed, Rene Ricard, Brigid Berlin, Warhol himself. For Acker, who'd long dreamed of joining Warhol's world, it was an exhilarating evening. Smith mesmerized her. Lots of rock stars fancied themselves poets, but few poets tried to turn themselves into rock stars. And even rarer and more thrilling\u2014a female poet, a female rock star. Smith was self-possessed, fierce, beyond androgynous. She reminded Acker of no one so much as herself, five years earlier, at Brandeis\u2014or at least how she wanted to be and wanted to be seen. \"She's gorgeous half male though she comes on very tough at the point of exploding into total femininity,\" Acker gushed in her notebook before, characteristically, turning on herself: \"I really like her have no way of meeting her of course I won't I probably like this being all shut in myself safe in the 42nd half fantasy real underground god forbid I should actually talk to someone who also writes\u2026\" Three months later, though, Acker would make her own Poetry Project debut, as part of an open mic reading on May 7. She had just turned twenty-four. It was her first public reading in New York. Acker read from her notebooks, and while her performance was considerably less theatrical than Smith's, she was thrilled by the enthusiastic response, especially from the women in the audience. In a letter to Jerome Rothenberg, she wrote that the night was \"\u2026 very beautiful I feel all religious all these women were coming up to me afterward and saying your stuff was really great it really moved me so I'm feeling terrific\u2026\" She realized then that she was in fact largely writing for women, and hoping that they would feel, hearing or reading her words, the same connection to her work that she felt when she read certain female poets or saw movies made by women. Women were a dominant force at the Poetry Project by then. Many of its earlier luminaries had achieved some mainstream success or moved to other parts of the country, but a younger generation was thriving at the church, largely influenced by the innovative work and thinking of poet Bernadette Mayer. Slim, radiant, beetle-browed, and irreverent, and just a couple years older than Acker, Mayer was considered a second-generation New York School poet, though her work was more overtly conceptual. In 1971, with Anne Waldman serving as the Poetry Project's director, Mayer began teaching weekly writing workshops that became renowned for the intellectual rigor she brought to them and the heterodox literary methods she espoused. Gathering as many as twenty poets at a time in the vestibule off the church's main sanctuary, she encouraged her students to read widely: everything from Curious George to Ludwig Wittgenstein. With the students, she devised a playful, generative catalogue of writing games, exercises, and prompts, such as \"Write a soothing novel in twelve short paragraphs,\" or \"Write as you think, as close as you can come to this, that is, put pen to paper and don't stop. Experiment writing fast and writing slow,\" or \"Rewrite someone else's writing. Experiment with theft and plagiarism.\" She recommended workshop participants keep a variety of journals: of their dreams, food they ate, tenant-landlord situations, skies they saw, times of solitude. While Acker never actually participated in these workshops herself, she was aware of their lessons, some of which resembled things David Antin had taught her. She already wrote as she thought, or as close as she could come. She already stole stories and images from other books and people. But she admired Mayer from afar, enchanted by her beauty and intellect. The two women, it turned out, shared a number of affinities. Like Acker, Mayer had endured a difficult childhood and had studied Greek and Latin. Like Acker, she had strong ties to the conceptual art world\u2014from 1967 to 1969, she co-edited a magazine of avant-garde writing with performance and video artist Vito Acconci (who was also married to Mayer's sister, the celebrated artist Rosemary Mayer), and Mayer's first major work, Memory, which she began in the summer of 1971, was a hybrid piece that combined photography and recorded narration. Mayer ignored the confines of genre and published everything from sonnet sequences and short stories to translations of Catullus and guides to science writing. Even within single works, she oscillated between poetry and prose, and she peopled her writing with both real-life figures and literary characters. Much of her work is a relentless interrogation of gender, interpretation, narrative, and authority. She revered Gertrude Stein. She experimented with the epistolary. She was a devotee of the stapled, mimeographed literary magazine, enthralled with its speed, immediacy, and democratic production. Ultimately, she offered a liberating literary model for Acker, and even if Acker later rarely mentioned Mayer as an influence, at least publicly, that influence was undeniable. Though Acker referred to Mayer in a notebook as \"a standoffish person,\" in December 1971, she also wrote, in a notebook dedicated to \"GERTRUDE STEIN & ALL LESBIANS\" (and subtitled \"DIARY TO FIND OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING\"), that Mayer's work \"touches reality\" and made her question her own. Later that month Acker gave Mayer one of her notebooks to read but almost immediately regretted it: \"she probably won't like it and I was wrong to do that I didn't know how else to get to her.\" More than forty years later, Mayer didn't remember reading that particular notebook or having that particular encounter, but she did recall Acker as a \"lively, vivid presence.\" The two women eventually became friends and later, for a brief moment, roommates. After that first open mic reading, Acker was at the church at least a couple days a week. She continued to read from her notebooks, and while the work had obvious kinship with Mayer's and Waldman's, which also involved collaging her diary writing with snatches of overheard found \"verse\" from the streets and the radio, Acker's writing was more aggressive and bluntly sexual. All three were obsessed with accurately and unapologetically representing feminine experience, but Acker went the furthest in complicating what was considered feminine. Even then, there was tension in the persona she projected in her writing: it was vulnerable, even abject, but also angry, tough, streetwise. Acker later claimed that the Poetry Project crowd was dismissive or hostile toward her, partly because she worked in the sex industry\u2014\"They thought I was some kind of pervert,\" she said, and \"I realized I'd never be one of them\"\u2014and she would tend to minimize St. Mark's importance in her development as a writer. But Mayer, retrospectively at least, thought Acker was extraordinarily gutsy, taking an exotic and precarious path no other writer she knew had dared to take. There was also a poetic resonance to it, Mayer said, that informed her work: \"Her writing was as schizophrenic as the life she was leading, going from philosophy and poetry to sex and back again. It was breathtaking.\" Waldman, for her part, came to consider Acker a \"hero,\" and said, decades later, that her writing was \"amazing, headstrong, important.\" Also a couple years Acker's senior, Waldman felt that their writing lives had been almost entwined, that they bounced off the same literary influences, and that they were united in producing neither \"left verse poetry with the usual tropes and epiphanies\" nor New Yorker\u2013friendly short fiction. \"There's a naughty, exhibitionistic girl-child at the center of it,\" Waldman said of Acker's work. \"It's un-subtle in interesting ways, revealing too, which makes it more democratic and honest. What other women were doing this?\" If anybody, it was certain male poets at the Poetry Project that may have been grousing about the exhibitionism of Acker's work. During one evening, Harris Schiff, who was assistant organizer of the reading series and with whom Acker had a brief affair, read a poem that criticized what he considered the overreliance on sexual content in the poetry of the day. Acker, who felt that Schiff didn't take her work seriously anyway, went on stage immediately after him, and proceeded to read some of her raunchiest passages. They never discussed the evening again. In late 1971 and into early 1972, Acker took the notebooks she filled at Fun City and Embers, her life in the more interesting depths, and began to slowly turn these pages into what would become her first chapbook.I Acker said that the book, titled Politics, was written under certain rules, \"rules which any academic poetry class would condemn as severely as the Spanish did the Jews.\" She wrote as quickly and badly as possible. While increasingly interested in narrative, she had no interest in traditional novelistic concerns. There were no \"well-rounded\" characters. She would not rewrite. This may have been true of her initial notebook compositions, which are relatively free of redaction or revision. (Specific dream sequences are, however, occasionally labeled as such.) But when the notebook entries were selected, typed up, and collated, Acker did, in fact, rewrite and reorder portions of the text. She framed the extracts from her 1971 notebooks with more abstract, less autobiographical pieces titled \"Ghost Story\" and \"Political Desire,\" as well as additional, untitled fragments or vignettes that do seem to also describe parts of her life. These fragments were also part of a larger typescript Acker titled Portraits, though it's unclear if she intended Portraits to be published as is, or if this was just an ongoing file of writing that she kept. In one of these fragments, for the first time in her published writing, Acker recounts the defining wound of her early childhood: \"I don't know who my father was. I don't know if my mother was married or not. I don't know if she wanted to have me or not. I don't know if she showed me she wanted me or not when I was a child but I presume from irrational beliefs deep within me that she didn't.\" This piece, which Acker titled \"Velvet Awareness\" in a different, separate typescript, ends with an all-caps pronouncement that Acker might have used as an epigraph for virtually every one of her future books: \"DOWN WITH THE FAMILY THE FAMILY IS THE WORST EVIL/IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS THE CAUSE OF EVIL EVERYWHERE.\" Acker later described Politics as \"little prose poems,\" but the central diary material\u2014perhaps because of the biographical window it opens, its reportorial snapshot of Times Square in the early seventies, or because it's littered with characters, as deliberately sketchy as they may be\u2014has an overt narrative momentum that Acker would later explore more directly. Divorced from its diaristic context, however, the section takes on a seething, and almost dream-like, texture. Politics was thirty-two pages long, including a title page indicating it was published by Papyrus Press in May 1972. According to Neufeld, there was no Papyrus Press\u2014\"it was just a name for her own self-publishing efforts\"\u2014but he had no recollection of where the name came from. Acker made photocopies, between two and three hundred, stapled the books herself, and then she and Neufeld distributed them to bookstores by hand and mailed them to friends. Among the poetry communities on both coasts, the book became a small sensation, with one poet likening it to Diane di Prima's frankly erotic Memoirs of a Beatnik, published three years earlier. Acker was delighted: \"\u2026 my desire to be seen and understood is na\u00efve but i [sic] am pleased it feels so exciting when i know my writing is in the world and not just trapped in my mind or these pages\u2026\" At the same time, she worried she might have made a mistake in focusing on what she called the \"sensational material.\" Anticipating similar struggles she'd have later in her career, Acker feared that the book's explicit sex would either give readers a distorted impression of her intentions or result in an unwanted kind of notoriety. \"I didn't want to become real famous,\" she later said, with some disingenuity. \"Not that I would, but I didn't want to chance it. Because I thought it would ruin me. It would have messed up my head.\" When publishers like Black Sparrow Press and Dial Press expressed interest in possibly reprinting the book, she was wary, and ultimately refused. \"The 42nd street shit that's only 1 part is NOT what my writing's about,\" she told Rothenberg. Even two decades later, in an interview with Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer, at various times her lover, mentor, and publisher\u2014and who would publish the sex show section of Politics in the Acker miscellany Hannibal Lecter, My Father\u2014she was still struggling with this conundrum. \"I was very scared,\" she told Lotringer, \"and thought if this gets published in a big way and people pick it up and listen to the sensationalism, because it's about the sex show, I'll never be a writer, that's it. You know, they'll put a frame around me, and that'll be it. So I didn't do it.\" \"But you have that anyway,\" Lotringer said, referring to her career at the time. \"Yeah, but I think this would have been worse, Sylv\u00e8re, I think it really would've been bad. Do you know what I mean? I couldn't have handled it back then. I was 20 years old.II You know, I don't know, this media hashes people up.\" Politics opens with an untitled fragment, a scene really, of an unnamed female narrator having sex with another woman:\n            I'm lying in bed with her I touch the visible scalp in the center of her forehead then I run my hands slowly down her long and messy locks we meet kissing for a long time feeling the texture of mouths then of the skin and the position of our bones the inset of the eye and the thinness of the ears the tenseness and warmth within our bones especially within the small of the back forces us to our and each other's sex: breasts and hair and smell for a very long time we arouse each other always with a minimum of caress warm heavy breasts salty bitterness of the hair under our arms that cats adore to lick we have our arms around each other's shoulders our bodies barely touch we look at each other her long brown hair very white skin she has a thin mouth that opens wide when she smiles brown eyes I like mine my hair is almost gone my face looks long like a child\u2026 This description, tender and tame, goes on for a page, becoming increasingly graphic and ecstatic. While the next piece or poem\u2014a caustic, partial portrait of Claire, seemingly\u2014sharply interrupts this opening moment, Acker returns a couple pages later to flick again at another, possibly different, sexual relationship with a woman. The hot-and-cold equivocation of this sequence aside, Acker's sexual interest in women was growing. As Acker's relationship with Neufeld cycled through love, indifference, and antipathy, she yearned for more satisfying, and less oppressive, romantic relationships. She believed that she could find these with women and, as the notebooks suggest, started to make deliberate attempts to cultivate them. \"I'm getting involved in womens lib actually lesbians lib to be honest,\" she wrote Rothenberg. Her notebooks and typescripts from the period are emblazoned with titles and subtitles like \"KEY WORD LESBIAN\" and \"Diary: Warm Cat Fur/Lesbian II\"; one notebook is \"dedicated\" to \"GERTRUDE STEIN & ALL LESBIANS.\" A paragraph in Poems 5/71\u20136/71 consists entirely of the word \"lesbian\" repeated sixty times. In a large, brown, spiral-bound notebook, titled \"Concrete Poems,\" she filled entire pages with the words \"myself,\" \"lesbian,\" \"angelic,\" and \"holy,\" repeating them in rows starting from the outermost edges and working inward. With some nervousness, she attended dances hosted by the Daughters of Bilitis, whose New York chapter was located in a loft on Prince Street; became infatuated with a couple of different women; flirted with other female performers in the sex show. \"Liking women means liking I'm a woman,\" she wrote in a notebook, though she later scratched this sentence out. She knew she was indulging, to a certain degree, a fantasy\u2014\"hopefully lesbians have more sense I don't enter that society because it's the only one left to idealize\"\u2014and once she started spending more time with gay women, she found herself as often confused and frustrated as she was giddy. She didn't agonize over her sexuality, per se, but she did agonize over what that attraction meant to, or for, her sense of self. In theory, being gay could mean ditching men once and for all, but, as she quickly learned, lesbians had their own specific hang-ups and complications. Most significantly, Acker insisted that she was bisexual, and she was irritated when other women insisted on more rigid categorization. In a notebook entry from January 19, 1972, she wrote:\n            \u2026 go to gay women's poetry reading read parts of earlier diaries mainly about self & cultural destruction no or hostile response perhaps because I mentioned word \"gonorrhea\" I made them uptight because I was pushing them to be conscious of their individual strangeness (unsureness) all other women read about being lesbians & got terrific responses. Feel old confusions because I'm not sure if I'm lying by reading at a lesbian gathering I don't want to deal with my self-image the way the group presents its image\u2026 Acker would eventually find more gratifying sexual relationships with women, and would solve this problem of self-image by insisting she was \"queer.\" But for the moment, anyway, being with women did little to assuage her loneliness. Neufeld continued to conduct multiple affairs and, even worse, Acker felt he wasn't a serious artist. Seeking more intellectual stimulation, she went back to grad school, starting a joint program in classics and philosophy at CCNY and NYU. She quickly realized that academia still bored her, though, and soon dropped out. With so much in disarray, from her domestic life to her sense of self, against her better judgment, Acker took a job. After they left the sex show, Neufeld had found work with Burt Lasky, whose small Riverdale firm provided editorial services, proofreading, and indexing to various New York publishing houses. After a while, Lasky hired Acker too, as a secretary. It didn't last long. While Lasky was, in Neufeld's memory, \"a very liberal guy,\" Acker was \"a little too unconventional and didn't fit in well at the office.\" Once again, straight work was anathema, and office life, to her mind, almost as sexist and demeaning as the sex show. She and Lasky yelled at each other constantly. In her Poems 5/71\u20136/71, she sourly summed up her opinion of all work that wasn't writing: \"Secretarial work shit file clerk work shit upper eschelon [sic] proofreading copy-editing publishing work shit advertising fashion money work shit unemployment work shit ass-licking work shit sex dancing work shit Medicaid work shit rich gynecologist reporting work shit government work shit richy work shit all university so-called learning work shit.\" She briefly went back to sex work, performing as a go-go dancer in New Jersey, but was appalled again by the men she worked and performed for. She was appalled by herself. \"I'm perpetrating the domination by men of women,\" she wrote. Even if writing was the only thing that wasn't shit, her relationship to it was changing. While she still called herself a poet, she also felt more and more estranged from the Poetry Project, which she now considered elitist, and the scene there dull, self-indulgent, and insular. At the end of The Burning Bombing of America: The Destruction of the U.S., a book she started working on right after Politics, she writes, \"ALL POETS BECOME OTHER POETS SAME THE SAME LINES ST. MARK'S CHURCH IS A REVOLUTIONARY CRUISE-JOINT.\" To her mind, even the form itself was unduly limiting. Prose seemed to offer greater possibilities, creative and otherwise. But, as she did with parts of Politics, she wanted to write prose the way that poets wrote poems\u2014explicitly engaging with language at the level of the sentence, and conceptually, using what she called a \"process.\" William Burroughs, whose work flickered productively between fiction and philosophy, had shown her how to do that, as had Gertrude Stein. But there were other examples, all around the world. The effects and influence of the nouveau roman, as conceived by writers like Alain Robbe-Grillet and Nathalie Sarraute, were still being felt in North America. Latin American literature was booming, with books as different as One Hundred Years of Solitude and Hopscotch finding avid English-reading audiences. In American fiction, postmodernism\u2014a term that would soon, to Acker's chagrin, be reflexively associated with her own work\u2014was in ascendance. Since the mid-sixties, experimental writing by the likes of John Barth, William Gaddis, and Thomas Pynchon had turned mainstream literature on its head while still, often, finding mainstream acceptance: in 1974, to cite just one major example, Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow shared the National Book Award with Isaac Bashevis Singer's A Crown of Feathers. Acker read all of these postmodernists, and loved some of them. But all of their writing showed her that you could write formally challenging, even difficult, fiction and it would find an eager audience. Maybe even more than that. Stein and Burroughs and Pynchon had all become, in their various ways, celebrities. Who knew how far she could go? I. It's not quite clear how much of her work her family actually read or even saw. Wendy remembered Acker giving Claire \"her first book,\" which may have been Politics but was more likely The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula. \"I don't think my mother got into it, didn't want to get into it,\" Wendy added. \"'You want to write about your family?' For my mother, that was the end of it.\" II. Unless Acker meant that she was twenty years old when she first began keeping the notebooks that comprised Politics, she was fudging or misremembering. She was actually twenty-five when the book was first published. ",
  "13": "FROM HER EARLIEST DAYS AS a writer, Acker's ambitions were almost entirely shaped by avant-garde, innovative, and experimental models. She had no interest in writing lyric or confessional poetry or middlebrow fiction. While she read widely, keeping a close eye on her contemporaries, she had little desire\u2014or arguably, the ability\u2014to produce work that was agreeable, expected, or docile. This was motivated by a familiar \u00e9pater la bourgeoisie and an elemental contrariness: \"I have a natural imp tendency to want to destroy.\" But it was also driven by idealism, a desire to make work that was nothing less than visionary, that could itself remake the world. \"Writers should present the human heart naked,\" she wrote, paraphrasing Edgar Allan Poe, \"so that our world, for a second, explodes in flames.\" She wrote to figure out why she acted in certain ways, why she thought in certain ways, how her memory worked, how experience was perceived and processed and represented, particularly the experience of reading, which remained perhaps the experience that most defined this most bookish of writers. She wrote to complicate herself. Unsurprisingly then, for the first many years of her writing life, she likewise spurned the traditional routes of publication, rarely submitting poetry or short fiction to major literary journals, or her novel manuscripts to agents and publishers. She instead formed her own spaces and channels, establishing her reputation first in the non-literary worlds of art, music, and performance. Her earliest books were self-published, and her work appeared only in alternative and small publications like David Meltzer's Tree, Lucy Sante's Stranded, and Mel Freilicher's Crawl Out Your Window. She would eventually coax the mainstream book industry toward her, though she would never shed her resistance to prevailing literary codes. Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer said that he never thought of her as a \"natural\" or \"easy\" writer, adding that she became one by \"hook or by crook.\" \"She's a different kind of writer,\" he said. \"She became a writer in spite of writing.\" Early on, Acker also renounced what many consider the very foundation of writing\u2014voice. For the vast majority of writers, developing or cultivating a literary voice is a natural part of becoming a writer; it's not an easy, logical, or always conscious process, but it is generally regarded as an essential and inevitable one, as routine as the creation of an individual personality. Your distinctive perspective, your worldview, your vocabulary\u2014all contribute to a writer's voice. And a significant part of this process is absorbing and then discarding the influence\u2014the voices\u2014of other writers. Almost as soon as she started seriously writing, Acker was suspicious of this very idea. It felt presumptive and oppressive, and she had zero faith in it. To begin with, why one voice? She didn't have a single voice. She constantly felt scattered, atomized, even schizophrenic, and shouldn't her writing reflect that? Like everyone, she had variable and multiple voices, registers, personalities, selves. \"A biography is considered complete if it merely accounts for six or seven selves,\" Virginia Woolf famously wrote in Orlando, \"whereas a person may well have as many as a thousand.\" Just as significantly, Acker found the idea paternalistic and patriarchal. To her mind, it privileged certain political perspectives and worldviews\u2014male, Western, white, heterosexual ones\u2014and naturalized them, made them universal and authoritative. There were, to use theorist Judith Butler's phrase, \"regulatory fictions\" that kept in place the idea of a subject that was unitary, transcendental, and rational. \"I was brought up in this poetry world where the idea was to express yourself,\" Acker said, \"and the last thing in the world I wanted to do was express myself.\" Acker preferred, she said, to \"pick everyone else's viewpoint, mush it all together.\" She didn't limit her attack to poets either, mocking the totalizing ambitions of establishment writers like Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, and John Updike. \"All those novelists have this thing about the great American novel. You have to write the Great American Novel. This perfect novel.\" She much preferred someone like the protean and prolific Jean-Luc Godard, whose ethos she described as \"just churn it out and if it's bad one time it's good the next.\" While the work of Mailer, et al., purported to represent some kind of universal experience, she considered it in fact \"superfluous.\" As a woman, as a poor person, as someone in pain, she didn't see herself in it at all. In the spring and summer of 1972, Acker was \"churning out\" writing that swerved between verse and prose. She collected several of these pieces in a kind of novella she titled The Burning Bombing of America: The Destruction of the U.S.I Like Politics, it uses reworked diary material and includes familiar figures\u2014Neufeld and Mayer, Jerome Rothenberg and Harris Schiff all make appearances. But the book is composed of several sections or chapters, with titles both austere\u2014\"Communist Aesthetics,\" \"Communist Story II,\" \"Abstract Essay Collaged with Dreams\"\u2014and absurd\u2014\"Outer Space Messages Total Chaos!\"\u2014and with a corresponding tone that shifts abruptly and frequently, from apocalyptic science fiction to revolutionary tract to alienated American yelp. At the end of the Bombing Burning typescript, Acker left a note to herself, presumably directions on how she should read the book aloud: \"read softly, evenly, like a story. 2 minutes per page.\" But Burning Bombing barely resembles a conventional story, or even a coherent one. If it does tell a story, it's that, perhaps, of the curdling of the counterculture. \"\u2026 Bob Dylan shits out money,\" she writes, \"notice where the money lies you'll find out where the killers lie the men who are annihilating the universe\u2026\" When Acker looked around New York, around America, all she saw was corruption, chaos, and alienation\u2014a society fractured, a country in turmoil, the debris of utopia. The previous couple of years had been marred by Altamont, the Manson murders, Kent State, the splintering of SDS, and the rise of the Weathermen. Acker, like others, remained appalled by the sexism and racism that had undermined the revolutionary movement. Though there's no such explanatory note attached to Burning Bombing, a note that prefaces a group of poems Acker titled simply \"Works Done 1968\" helps frame her use of \"communist\" in the novella: \"By the word 'Communist' in these poems, I do not mean the Communist Party. To some extent I had them or some party in mind when I wrote many of the poems; I have found some of their members to be fascist pigs. By 'communist' I remind of 'communal' an imaginary communist group or world which I have not found yet to exist, the nearest being certain relations between women.\" Indeed, while Burning Bombing is often bleak and horrifying, it's enlivened by moments of exhilaration. Things fall apart, but can be rebuilt in new and better ways. Other worlds are always possible. Burning Bombing of America was never published in Acker's lifetime\u2014it doesn't seem like she tried to publish it or even wanted to\u2014but Grove Press released it in 2002, with a note by editor Amy Scholder suggesting it was written \"after Pierre Guyotat's \u00c9den \u00c9den \u00c9den.\" Guyotat was one of France's most daring and controversial novelists, a darling of renowned thinkers like Michel Foucault, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Jacques Derrida. His first novel, 1967's Tomb for 500,000 Soldiers, was a hallucinatory, psychosexual account of his time as a young soldier in the Algerian War. He was an extremely important writer for Acker, and would remain so for her entire life. \u00c9den \u00c9den \u00c9den was published in France in July 1970, though also prohibited from being sold to anyone under eighteen, and not translated into English for several years. In fact, Acker would translate it herself about nine years later. Set in Algeria, it's written in a lexicon and style\u2014visceral, incantatory, taxing\u2014quite distinct from conventional French prose. It consists of a single, unending, 256-page sentence, punctuated by colons, slashes, dashes, and swarming with repetitive, corporeal images. Bodies sweat, ingest, shit, gleam, bleed, quiver, fight, fuck. In its fusion of the avant-garde and the classical\u2014the book is really a kind of epic\u2014it was tailor-made for Acker. For her, Guyotat was trying to \"get beyond human psychology\" in his novels, to arrive at a material reality uninhibited by neurosis and idealism. Burning Bombing was perhaps written less \"after\" \u00c9den \u00c9den \u00c9den and more in dialogue with it. Acker's America was broken and malevolent, but it was not the war-torn Algerian desert. The writing borrows the aggression, acceleration, and, to a small degree, Guyotat's typographic innovations, but it is still gentler, more overtly domestic and personal. The book's opening lines and pages\u2014\"armies defect first in the woods and polluted lakes the cities small towns are covered in the blood of God in the burrows and hidden alleyways of unknown anarchists criminals buggering and fucking for ages\u2026\"\u2014most strongly echo Guyotat, but, as in her later books, that appropriation is soon abandoned or juxtaposed with other styles, other appropriations, other texts. Acker dedicated a couple of sections of Burning Bombing to Neufeld, but their three-year-old relationship was more or less over by the time she had finished the book. In the fall of 1972, she typed up a poem, \"Breaking Up,\" culled from longer entries in a notebook titled Household Objects, that seemed entirely composed of conversations between the two of them. Though none of the poem's lines is explicitly ascribed to either person, sentiment like this, which comes near its end, can clearly be attributed to Neufeld: \"you don't accept responsibility/you use men/you fear men\" and \"I've done everything/you're entirely irresponsible/you're unable to care for anyone but yourself.\" The end of the relationship was hastened, however, by a new romance that Acker began about a month before she wrote \"Breaking Up.\" In August, unemployed and at creative loose ends, she flew out to San Diego to visit Mel Freilicher and the Antins, hoping, it seemed, for some guidance and comfort. It wasn't a long trip and Acker left her stuff back in Washington Heights. When she found out that Jeff Weinstein had agreed to deliver a car cross-country to New York, she asked if she could tag along. Weinstein said sure, but that they would have another passenger with them, a buddy of his named Peter Gordon. Gordon was a twenty-one-year-old UCSD music student and aspiring composer, four years Acker's junior. He was gentle, generous, and cherubic, with full lips that matched Acker's own. If the small, wide-eyed Acker appeared childlike far into adulthood, Gordon looked, some said, like a giant baby. He was born in New York, spent his childhood in Virginia, and then his teen years in Munich, where his father worked as a journalist for Voice of America. In Germany, Gordon learned to play clarinet and saxophone and received an eclectic musical education: he watched the Munich opera perform Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg, and in clubs caught the likes of Duke Ellington, James Brown, and Ray Charles, even performing once himself with Chuck Berry. After Germany, the family moved to Los Angeles, where Gordon, then a senior in high school, ended up befriending a neighbor, Don Van Vliet, aka Captain Beefheart, and hung around as Beefheart recorded Trout Mask Replica, the landmark double album that launched a thousand avant-rock acts. While at UCSD, Gordon had a band, one of many he would form over the next few years, that transformed pop hits into free-form improvisations, and similar to Acker's feelings about contemporary poetry, he considered the art music of the time \"elitist\" and sought to make music that was \"hedonistic but also brainy.\" He and Acker hit it off. Too well, at times, for Weinstein\u2014they were soon having sex in the back seat of the car while he, somewhat exasperated, chauffeured them across the country. Weinstein was a bit surprised that they became so close so fast\u2014they seemed like very different people to him\u2014but Gordon was undeniably smitten. \"She was fascinating,\" Gordon recalled. \"She had this incredible energy: a certain self-centeredness, yet sort of an inherent na\u00efvet\u00e9, which was charming.\" He found her funny too, and affectionate, warm, and vulnerable. By the time they got to the East Coast, he had more or less fallen for her. Though Neufeld was still living in their apartment, Gordon ended up crashing there with Acker too. Neufeld didn't begrudge him anything\u2014he blamed Acker entirely for their breakup\u2014and he and Gordon eventually became reasonably good friends. After a week, Gordon returned to California. Three weeks later, and much to his surprise, Acker showed up at his apartment with her books and cats. They hadn't really discussed moving in together, and Gordon had never before lived with a girlfriend, but he nonetheless received her with open arms. (Not the cats, though\u2014he was allergic, and they were soon re-homed.) Gordon lived in an apartment in Solana Beach, the first neighborhood where Acker had lived with Bob Acker, and she was grateful to be living by the ocean once again. She reconnected with her old San Diego friends, joining a women's meditation group that Pauline Oliveros ran, planning a new literary and art magazine with Mel Freilicher. She seemed grateful for everything, in fact, especially for the chance to start over again. In a letter to Harris Schiff, who had decamped to New Mexico himself, she wrote, \"Split w/ Lenny & couldn't stand NY raped every night lungs couldn't function\u2026 anyway also there was this musician in S.D. I love\u2014so I split to S.D.! and! here! am I!\u2026\" To Bernadette Mayer, she described San Diego as \"paradise.\" She and Gordon would occasionally drive to L.A. to visit Gordon's family or to catch a concert, staying overnight. While at first Gordon's parents \"didn't know what hit them,\" Acker fit in surprisingly well. His father wrote plays and he and Acker bonded over literature. She even showed him her writing, which he gave her feedback on (but which he kept hidden from Gordon's mother, a psychotherapist). Acker often joined her and Gordon's grandmother in the kitchen and helped them cook. Before she moved out west, Acker had repeated in a letter to Gordon the \"DOWN WITH THE FAMILY\" couplet that she'd included in Politics, but the Gordons, it seemed, were the Jewish family that she wished she had\u2014or at least a family she felt comfortable and connected with. She soon started to refer to Peter as her brother; it was, she told Schiff, \"a sacred relationship.\" But as usual, she was broke (and now, after airfares, $500 in debt). Gordon had a grad school fellowship and his parents were also still helping to support him. He happily shared that money with Acker, but it wasn't a lot. To make ends meet, by that fall, she had started stripping in sailor bars around San Diego. It was a return to the sex industry, but a far cry from Times Square. \"It was performing,\" Gordon said, \"not like turning tricks. It was a show.\" She adopted a pseudonym, Target, and worked a circuit of different joints, sometimes performing for sailors just about to head off to Vietnam. Dancers supplied their own music, and Acker danced to the Velvet Underground or jazz musicians like Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane. While other dancers employed popular dance moves, Acker would call upon her classes with Meredith Monk and, Gordon said, \"dance interpretively, bringing out the angst, as well as the erotic joy.\" Full nudity was illegal in the city, so Acker wore a wig and various costumes; Gordon's grandmother, a lover of vaudeville, helped sew sequins onto her outfits. \"It's a nice place to work as a stripper,\" Acker later told an interviewer. \"You didn't get much money but sailors turn out to be very nice people.\" Through that winter, Acker read Henry James, Wilkie Collins, and Malcolm Lowry, and while she continued to write poetry, by the spring of 1973, she had also begun a novel. Titled Rip-off Red, Girl Detective,II it was a far different project than either Politics or Burning Bombing. It had the veneer of conventional, representational fiction\u2014a semblance of plot, loosely drawn characters, suspense\u2014and Acker even gave its typescript a kind of pulp fiction cover: a partial line drawing of a reclining woman, captioned with the expression \"\u200a'Nuff said!?!,\" Stan Lee's familiar Marvel Comics sign-off. It included a dedication too: \"For my brother Peter Peter.\" Acker didn't use her real name as author, however, preferring to use Rip-off Red as both pen name and titular character. Peter Peter is also the name of a character in the book, secretary and partner to Red, who describes herself as a \"superdetective.\" At the novel's opening, Red is planning to go from California to New York and \"rip off the money\" from the city's anarchists and junkies. On the plane there, Red meets a woman named Sally Spitz, who's trying to figure out why her father, a jeweler, keeps vanishing every night for several hours. Red takes the case. Before long, however, Spitz is murdered while at her parents' place, an apartment building at 57th Street and First Avenue, Acker's childhood address. Red vows to avenge her death. While Spitz may have grown up in Red/Acker's apartment, and has Acker's own daddy issues, it's Red herself who explicitly shares parts of Acker's biography. In the novel's second part, a flashback takes Red to her early childhood and teenaged years where, as the daughter of \"Oiving\" and \"Clear,\" she shuttles between wealth and poverty, travels through various New York boroughs, and forms a preposterously named criminal gang, the Banana Followers, with Harvey the Bagel and Weirdo the Rat. They rumble with a rival gang called the Tomatoes. Young Red learns to masturbate, to have sex, to hate her parents, to dream, to flee, to change her name. After this interlude, Acker returns to the plot, which speeds, with knowing absurdity, toward a conclusion that anyone familiar with Acker's work will find unsurprising: Spitz was murdered by her father. Acker described the novel as \"basically about illusion vs. illusion very abstract.\" Many of its pages are spent describing the sex that Red has with Peter Peter and various other men and women. The passages are detailed and breathless, raunchy, and repetitive. Acker wrote these pages for her own titillation, but also to make the book commercially appealing. She knew that other serious writers\u2014the Scottish novelist Alexander Trocchi, the poet Diane di Prima\u2014had written porn novels for money, and she thought Rip-off Red, if sold and marketed as such, could bring in a few hundred dollars. (Grove Press, she told Gordon, would be the \"perfect publisher.\") In a letter to Bernadette Mayer, she called it a \"pornography mystery\" and likened it to the cult anti-Western film Billy Jack: \"You're so entertained so much sex you don't know you're being blurped on the head until you fall down WHOOM.\" Acker spent eight hours a day working on it, off and on for six months. It never did make her any money, and like Burning Bombing, would languish, unpublished, among her papers for several years after her death. But it was her first long investigation into actual narrative, her first experimentation with genre conventions, the first inklings of the staccato, hard-boiled style she'd employ in her future writings. The book's final lines\u2014\"I'm no longer a detective. I'll decide to become someone else.\"\u2014would also herald the next significant chapter in her evolution as a writer. As a pseudonym, Acker would hold on to Rip-off Red a bit longer, but she would soon also adopt a more enduring and life-changing alias\u2014The Black Tarantula. I. The typescript of Burning Bombing reverses the order of the title and there is no colon between the two separate titles\u2014i.e., The Destruction of the U.S. The Burning Bombing of America\u2014but I have preserved the order as it appears in the Grove Press edition from 2002. II. Again, there's a slight discrepancy in the title. According to the typescript in Acker's Duke archive, the title eschews the hyphen and a colon is used instead of the comma: Ripoff Red: Girl Detective. I have again, however, deferred to the style of the 2002 Grove Press edition, Rip-off Red, Girl Detective. ",
  "14": "GORDON'S SOLANA BEACH APARTMENT WAS just around the corner from the Antins' house, and when Acker returned to California in late 1972, a more purposeful and experienced writer than when she left, that friendship became even more important. The two couples frequently met for breakfast, and she and Gordon occasionally babysat the Antins' son, Blaise. The Antins had been experimenting with new forms themselves and had arrived at methods and ideas that would, in ways subtle and significant, influence Acker's next artistic steps. David had already introduced Acker to the use of found materials, collage, and appropriation. But he added to that a different notion of how a poem might be written and performed, reversing the order of that process in fact, or turning it inside out. In April 1972, David was invited to give a reading at the art department of Pomona College, a couple hours north of San Diego. Rather than reading from notes or a published book, however, he simply cleared his throat and began to speak, improvising a lecture on art and art-making that was by turns witty, profound, and bracing. On the drive home, he and Elly listened to a recording of the talk, and Elly said, with characteristic certitude, \"That's a poem.\" David typed it up, and that talk, \"talking at pomona,\" became the first of what he would call \"talk\" poems. Artforum published it later that fall, and he also included it in his Kulchur Press book Talking. The talk poems became David's renowned, beloved signature, his own microgenre. It was speaking as thinking, talking as writing. The poems illustrated the power of improvisation, how capacious poetry really could be, and the pleasurable friction produced when combining the high- and lowbrow\u2014he moved deftly and sometimes comically between Wittgensteinian language games and quasi\u2013Borscht Belt routines about his mother. But David was quick to say that he wasn't an entertainer, and unlike, say, later examples like Spalding Gray or Garrison Keillor, he didn't \"give a damn if half the audience walks out.\" He was a master of metaphor, a master of the emblematic story, and his talk poems swarmed with both. A bit earlier, but continuing into 1973, Elly had started her own equally winning conceptual art project, 100 Boots. She placed a hundred black rubber boots on the beach below their house, facing the sea, and took a photograph of them. At David's suggestion, she made more pictures, all while moving the footwear from location to location\u2014outside a church, in a field, at an amusement park, at a Greek nightclub\u2014with, over time, the boots traveling from California to New York, where they made their way to MoMA. Over two-and-a-half years, Elly made fifty-one such pictures, which she turned into postcards and mailed to a list of a thousand people and institutions around the world. The boot's adventures became more fantastic\u2014they committed a crime, had a love affair. She first thought of the series as a picaresque novel in the vein of Huckleberry Finn or On the Road, and then more as a set of stills from a movie serial like The Perils of Pauline. The project, Elly said, was conceived to \"circumvent some of the spatial and temporal limits imposed on an artist whose work is shown in a gallery setting.\" It became a key piece in the relatively new medium of mail art, made most famous by Ray Johnson and various members of Fluxus. But Elly was busy with much more than her boots. Continuing her earlier investigations into identity, gender, and race, from the early seventies on, she created and adopted several fictional \"alternative selves,\" the performances of which she documented in several photographs and videos over the next couple of decades. She donned a fake mustache and beard, wig, floppy bucket hat, cape, and boots and became the King, a valiant, if impotent, monarch raging against the wealthy landowners of Solana Beach. For several weeks, she also assumed the identity of a fictional Black ballerina from Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, a blackface performance which Elly said she intended as a show of solidarity but which was later criticized as exploitative, ill-advised appropriation. Less problematic were two fictional white nurse characters, Nurse Eleanor and Eleanor Nightingale, both of whom appeared in videos she made in the late seventies. \"I consider the usual aids to self-definition\u2014sex, age, talent, time and space\u2014as tyrannical limitations upon my freedom of choice,\" Elly famously declared. These performances were part of a small, pioneering, contemporaneous wave of such work from women artists. In New York in 1973, Black conceptual artist Adrian Piper applied her own fake mustache, along with sunglasses and an Afro wig, for a project called The Mythic Being, in which she took diary entries she'd written as a teenager and presented them (in both Village Voice advertisements and live on city streets) as a physically different person. Suzy Lake's series of large-scale photographic self-portraits\u2014Transformations, from 1973 and '74\u2014depicted her \"becoming\" other women, men, and children. In San Francisco, the artist and filmmaker Lynn Hershman Leeson created a fictitious alter-ego named Roberta Breitmore, whom Leeson \"played\" in a series of actual real-life activities-cum-performances\u2014getting a driver's license, renting an apartment, undergoing psychoanalysis. There was a certain hybridity to all this work, with each artist borrowing and blending tropes and techniques from film, photography, and literature, all to make a new kind of conceptual art obsessed with role-playing, biography, perception, and gender. With Rip-off Red, Acker had attempted something similar, fusing noir, philosophy, and porn. The more time she spent with conceptual artists\u2014and also musicians, thanks to Peter Gordon\u2014the more that both visual art strategies and methods of musical composition illuminated new directions for her fiction. Though she would later reconsider and dismiss this idea, she learned from the conceptualists that what mattered most in making art was knowing why you did what you did. For a writer, she now felt, it was not enough to blindly, automatically use the language and methods given to you, which is what she believed most English-language novelists unthinkingly did. The conceptualists were also cannier about the circulation of their art, or at least had developed multiple ways to get it in front of people, to make a lasting impression. Elly's mailing list was one way, but there were also, of course, art galleries of various size and description, public spaces, magazines, even TV. Elly had a theory about the art world too, and it was something that Acker took to heart\u2014to get them to pay attention to you, you have to do the same thing over and over. \"It was not cynical,\" Mel Freilicher recalled. \"It was like, this is what you have to do. You have to make certain moves. It's not a question of pandering or doing what will sell. It's being emphatic.\" In June 1973, Acker started a new notebook, a UCSD-branded spiral-bound one, working out in its first few pages De Morgan's Laws, the rules of logic named for the nineteenth-century British mathematician Augustus De Morgan. Several of her notebooks from the period, in fact, (as well as brief passages in her earliest published books) are dappled with her musings on epistemology, perception, logical forms, memory, and language, influenced by her reading of philosophers like Henri Bergson, Gustav Bergmann, and Wittgenstein. At one point, she \"interviewed\" David Antin, with her purported questions and Antin's answers a collage of her, or their, own words and sentences cribbed from Wittgenstein's On Certainty. \"Do you care whether you can know I want to fuck you?\" Acker asks, tongue somewhere near her cheek. After dozens of pages of exercises and truth tables, however, the real work of the notebook begins. At the top of a page, Acker writes, \"Intention: I become a murderess by repeating in words the lives of other murderesses.\" Below that, in caps: \"THE CHILDLIKE LIFE OF THE BLACK TARANTULA.\" Acker repeats this on the front of the notebook, writing above it with typical self-deprecation, \"A Minor Work.\" This \"minor work,\" would, in fact, be a major breakthrough. Taking the autobiographical second part of Rip-off Red, Acker expands it, combining it with vignettes describing her daily life (set off in parentheses) and, most significantly, plagiarized, reworked extracts from historical crime books like Edward Hale Bierstadt's Enter Murderers: Eight Studies in Murder and Blood in the Parlor by Dorothy Dunbar. She continued this work into a second notebook, this one with the title THE BLACK TARANTULA DRIVES HERSELF INSANE: A DOCUMENT. Here, she writes \"by The Black Tarantula\" and, at the top of the notebook's cover, \"THE BLACK TARANTULA HAS ALMOST ELIMINATED HER IDENTITY. SHE BEGINS TO ELIMINATE HER FEAR.\" Between the two notebooks, she composed about thirty pages in this style. The piece's final sentence reads, \"I'm hysterical start screaming louder and louder,\" but in an accompanying note, Acker wrote with apparent satisfaction, \"calm end 'poetic.'\u200a\" In letters and on manuscripts, Acker would soon regularly be calling herself The Black Tarantula, TBT for short. But who was The Black Tarantula? Why The Black Tarantula? If Acker ever had a good reason for the pseudonym it's been forgotten or she never publicly divulged it. \"It's just another name,\" she told a friend at the time, \"and I like black, very sleazy.\" Years later, she told Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer that, back then, \"everybody wore make-up, everybody dressed up all the time and everybody changed their names. So I made up a name for myself. I liked tarantulas in those days, and I probably like them now. Mexican kids keep them as pets.\" She went on, seemingly also talking about how she saw herself: \"Everyone thinks they're horrible but they're really sensual, really soft and furry. They're not terribly dangerous. The worse thing they do is sting like a bee.\" But the name obviously had a number of alluring connotations. It conferred anonymity and secrecy, suggested danger and death. It could have been the name of a superhero, or a spy. It made her something other than a woman, other than human. It again, immediately, placed her identity in quotes and up for grabs. \"Being a poet and working with language is a lot like being a spider,\" David Antin wrote in \"The Structuralist\"\u2014a talk poem that offers some clues to Acker's work\u2014and \"working with silk because the language comes out of your mouth much the way thread comes out of a spider so that it looks like you've made it but only in a way\u2026\" Acker would later sometimes sign letters with just a hand-drawn, almost abstract, tarantula: a black dot with eight filament-like legs that curve outward like a sun's rays. As for the writing itself, what was this thirty-page whatsit supposed to be? Another prose poem? A story? The first chapter of a novel? Acker later said that she had the \"idea of doing like a Dickens novel, a serial where I'd send out chapters every month,\" though it's not clear when this idea occurred to her. There were other cultural examples of serials, of course\u2014pulp novels, on radio, in the movies\u2014and the tenor of Acker's piece hewed closer to the spirit of these. When she showed the work to the Antins, Elly suggested that Acker send the serials to everyone on the mailing list she made for 100 Boots. The two women had become closer\u2014\"I've never opened up to anyone before so much about my work,\" Acker said\u2014and she leapt at the idea. Acker soon began sending the chapters\u2014typed up, then mimeographed at a local newspaper office and stapled together\u2014often without identifying herself as their author, to artists and writers she did and didn't know: among them, the Rothenbergs, Sitney, Jackson Mac Low, Ed Ruscha, Barbara Barracks, Vito Acconci, Carolee Schneemann, Lawrence Weiner, Robert Duncan, John Perrault, Ron Silliman, Grove Press's Barney Rosset. \"That list in the pre-internet days was gold,\" the poet Eileen Myles wrote. \"You could actually reach out and touch the inside of all these people's mailboxes.\" Gordon helped her, stapling pages, stuffing envelopes. Acker tucked in the envelopes her own small, wry card, which read: \"You are on the enemy list of The Black Tarantula.\" Some recipients were puzzled, others intrigued, even thrilled, by the work. The format was modest, even primitive, but the writing was both anguished and aggressive. Her web grew quickly. \"She became the darling of the art world,\" Elly recalled. (Though not without a hint of retrospective rancor\u2014after Acker became well known, she regularly gave David Antin his due as a major influence, but almost never mentioned Elly.) \"It was about setting up friendships,\" Acker said of these early pamphlets. \"As if they were little letters to people that I sent out.\" The communication, in some cases, went two ways. In 1974, for example, Schneemann, a multidisciplinary artist best known for experimental performances and films like Meat Joy and Fuses, published Cezanne, She Was a Great Painter, an artist's book comprising letters and fragments from Acker's notebooks, manifestoes, and performance scripts. Included was a poem titled \"For The Black Tarantula,\" which argues, midway, in all-caps: \"OUR CIVILIZATION IS TO SPEAK TO EACH OTHER/CIVILIZATION IS THOUGHTS OF OUR BODIES.\" \"I'm sick of not fucking knowing who I am,\" Acker writes in Politics. The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula was a way, she said, of figuring that out. But her method, as she outlined it anyway, was quixotic. Of all the things she knew and didn't know about herself, she knew, definitively, that she had never murdered anyone. So she raided the crime and law sections of the UCSD library and checked out all the biographies and autobiographies of famous female murderers she could find. She copied out sections from these books and then essentially inserted them into and alongside autobiographical sections that detailed her troubled family history, her money and health concerns, her current sex life and affairs. It was a real experiment, with these autobiographical sections serving, she said, as the \"control.\" In a letter to Jackson Mac Low, she described this technique in depth:\n            The Black Tarantula series (one's coming out a month) is basically my way of making myself schizophrenic, schizophrenic w/out the censor (identity, superego, causer of similar patterns) I half make up my own words, half use other people's jargon which slightly fits\u2026 the idea that if I'm do [sic] this slowly and don't scare myself by sudden shocks I'll be able to deal w/ other people more honestly & directly, evolve new ways of being with people, better ones, I'll break thru my overwhelming paranoia\u2014crack up the old identity god. So I copy texts (get rid of style, expressionism in writing) + become the people of the texts\u2026 In the second installment of The Childlike Life of the Black Tarantula, Acker writes, \"I want to read books about schizophrenia, especially Laing's books and the books from Kingsley Hall. I'm getting sick of pornography and murders which is all I used to be interested in.\" And, indeed, Acker had immersed herself in such literature, reading books like Mary Barnes and Joseph Berke's Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness. She was particularly fascinated by R. D. Laing, the radical Scottish psychiatrist, and the ideas around schizophrenia that he explored in The Divided Self and Sanity, Madness and the Family. For Laing, madness was liberation and renewal, mental illness more theory than fact. \"Insanity is a perfect response to an insane world,\" Laing famously wrote. In a 1984 essay on Goya and Caravaggio, Acker reformulated this statement: \"The only reaction against an unbearable society is equally unbearable nonsense.\" Later in her life, as Acker's behavior became more erratic, narcissistic, and paranoid, Gordon and many other friends would suspect she suffered from undiagnosed borderline personality disorder, even possibly dissociative identity disorder. Certainly, qualities that she exhibited throughout her life\u2014a fear of abandonment, impulsiveness, disproportionate anger, frequent mood swings\u2014are symptoms of borderline personality disorder. But a posthumous diagnosis is impossible, of course, and risks pathologizing behavior, or thinking, that, as extreme as it could sometimes be in Acker's case, is hardly uncommon. More important is the fact that Acker zealously repudiated psychotherapy and analysis her entire life. She never had a conventional therapist, never sought, as far as we know, any course of psychiatric treatment; she had no interest in being \"cured\" or \"fixed.\" When she learned that Bernadette Mayer was seeing the celebrated analyst David Rubinfine, for example, she was horrified, arguing that Rubinfine was \"brainwashing\" her. \"I told Kathy it was none of her business,\" Mayer said. \"But she didn't approve of anything that so smacked of the bourgeoise.\" Perhaps. But Acker's attitudes may have stemmed from her many years of poverty, when she received inconsistent, even slipshod, treatment from various free clinics. She was also extremely suspicious of all authority, medical or otherwise. Gordon thought there was yet another reason, that Acker \"saw psychological pain as being her source of creativity.\" To interrogate this heartache then, with the aim of somehow reducing or altering it, could, theoretically anyway, destroy it. But there was more to it than that. The antipsychiatry of Laing\u2014and later, Deleuze and Guattari's incendiary, anti-capitalist critiques of Freud and Lacan\u2014was revolutionary for Acker. These philosophers offered a more productive, even joyful, way of slipping the confines of self and social order. They showed how fruitful paradox and contradiction can be. In The Childlike Life, the narrator constantly fractures or refracts, almost ecstatically describing an ever-shifting physical appearance and worldview. Now they are a woman, now they are a man, now they are a spider. Now they are Kathy, now they are Silver Gold Lam\u00e9 (another alias), now they are The Black Tarantula. Now they are a node, a network, a nothing.I \"I look at my body as if it were a web,\" Acker writes in one of the loveliest passages in her early work, \"solely a way of asking people to touch me. My body doesn't exist. I watch myself: I'm now heavy and even more beautiful: huge curves of thighs zooming into the valleys around my belly I begin to love myself as if I'm someone else no I realize my attractiveness coldly, I basically couldn't care how I look; I can see anything in a set of shifting frameworks. I'm interested solely in getting into someone else. I find the heavy flesh sensual, as if it were permanent. I'm not sure if I think of myself as a person.\" Maybe, contra Politics, it didn't matter so much if she didn't know who she was. Maybe it was more important that her identity didn't remain settled or fixed, that she was always becoming someone, or something, else. Acker worked tirelessly on The Childlike Life, tallying up the words on the inside back cover of her notebooks. She typically wrote three to four thousand words a day. Writing by day, stripping by night\u2014it was a considerably more relaxed version of the life she'd had in New York. Not without its difficulties, as she notes in this exemplary paragraph, but it was relatively stable: \"I live quietly I change my way of life I eat grains vegetables some dairy products because I have an ulcer I'm too poor to see a doctor about once a month I fall in love with someone at the same time I live with Peter who I love I rarely form friendships I deal awkwardly with people I fall in love with.\" She still also struggled from time to time with severe depression, and Gordon would do his best to help her. \"You knew there was a dark side,\" he said, \"but it took a while to see how deep it could really get. She would have these descending spirals of darkness that couldn't be stopped.\" This darkness manifested itself in harrowing ways: Acker would fixate completely on things, or utterly withdraw, becoming practically catatonic, and retreat to her \"cocoon-like\" bed. She still occasionally cut herself, and in letters over the next few years, there was the odd mention of suicidal thoughts. In Rip-off Red, Acker suggests that she even tried to hang herself once, though Gordon has no recollection of this. During these bouts of depression, he would cook and feed her miso soup, try to nurse her, but sometimes, he said, nothing consoled her, and they both just rode out the episodes. It's impossible to know how much this was bound up in Acker's relationship to her family. But, obviously, she repeatedly dredged up old offenses and indignities as she wrote, and this process inevitably affected her mood. As distant as they were from her physically, her extended family was never far from her psychically. Gordon recalled a road trip to Tijuana, where Acker bought an embroidered blouse with a high collar. \"I look just like my mother in this,\" she said. She wore it with pearls given to her by Nana. Around this time Acker also started to get semi-regular abortions. An early piece titled \"Murderers-Criminals Join Sunlight,\" which was part of a short sequence of poetic exercises and subtitled: \"Exercise #1: Create Music Through Repetitions of Own Sounds,\" lists the dates of two of her abortions before the poem begins: 10/28/72, 11/2/72. The dates line up with what she told Bernadette Mayer in a letter from the same time, that she had one unsuccessful abortion and then a second one four days later (\"which I hoped worked because I'm broke\"). While some women find the abortion procedure deeply difficult, emotionally painful, and frightening, Acker tended to treat these operations with relative ease. She seemed to attach little psychological baggage to them, and she was publicly dismissive of their difficulty, treating abortion, more or less, as a form of birth control. \"She dealt with them very casually,\" Gordon recalled. Indeed, Acker seemed to almost revel in the act, as a defiance of certain societal norms, but also as a refusal, again, to have her body policed by anything or anybody. In the early nineties, in San Francisco, she went straight from an abortion to a photo shoot with her friend the philosopher Avital Ronell. Ronell was shocked, and when she expressed concern, a cavalier Acker waved it off\u2014\"Why are you being such a girl?\" In her writing, abortions would signify other things. In Blood and Guts in High School, she writes, \"Abortions are the symbol, the outer image, of sexual relations in this world.\" A graphic scene in an abortion clinic opens her Don Quixote, with the operation portrayed as an enlightening, even generative, process. In Memoriam to Identity, her feelings about the procedure are just as complex and political: \"When a woman's body turns into a baby-wanting machine and if the woman doesn't want a baby, she has to wage war against herself.\" And a few pages later, \"Since life and death are inextricably mixed, you can't condemn abortion. Maybe that's why I had so many abortions.\" Clearly, for all of her professed love of Gordon, she didn't want to have kids with him. Nor was she interested in a monogamous relationship with him. At the beginning of June, at the Antins', she met a writer and artist named Dan Graham, whom she quickly developed a crush on. Graham was five years older, and already an instrumental figure in the conceptual art world. She liked his work and his ideas about art, and he was friends with Bernadette Mayer too, another endorsement. He also had what she called \"a body I like: heavy enough to run into and feel its weight on me.\" But their romance, such as it was, was brief and unsatisfying. In The Childlike Life, Graham appears as D, a character who sleeps just once with the narrator and then promptly ghosts her:\n            I call up D in Los Angeles do you want to sleep with me with me when and where there why don't you spend a few days with me I'll call you tomorrow. No call three days later I'm maniacal I have to see D I don't know him hello I've got a ride to Los Angeles lie I'm not sure I know where we can stay should I not come up come up. We don't touch talk about anything personal spend night together I have to be at Irvine in the morning I'm busy call me Friday. Do you want me to call you yes. I call Friday call Saturday Sunday this is Kathy O uh do you want to spend a night with me again are you too busy I'm too busy uh goodbye have a good time in New York uh goodbye. In real life, the day after this dispiriting interlude, a tortured Acker wrote to Mayer asking for any information she might have about Graham. It's not clear what Mayer told her, if anything. But the D character floats through several chapters of The Childlike Life, a ghostly nonentity who is emblematic, finally, of an indifferent art world, cruel and unthinking men, and Acker's own vulnerability. Later, in a letter to Jackson Mac Low, she downgraded Graham to simply \"this artist creep\" who \"doesn't talk about anything but art.\"II Gordon more or less shrugged off these infatuations, which he saw as almost performative. \"It wasn't like I loved the idea but it was a funny thing,\" he said. \"It was almost like exploring different characters or something for her.\" He appreciated too that she was open and honest about the affairs, and never tried to deceive him. In any case, he enjoyed his own occasional dalliances and was also preoccupied with his own burgeoning career. By that summer, he had grown tired of the music program at UCSD and its emphasis on \"rigid, post-serialist modernism.\" He decided to transfer to Mills College in Oakland. John Cage had taught there, and, in his wake, it became an epicenter of experimental music: Terry Riley and Robert Ashley were on the faculty; Steve Reich, Trisha Brown, and Laurie Anderson were all, at one point or another, students. Acker agreed to join him. She didn't really want to leave San Diego, but she didn't think she could make money there any other way than stripping, and that lifestyle had become wearisome. Despite her ambivalence about the poetry community, she craved again the company of a wider circle of writers. And both of them wanted to live in a big city again but not necessarily New York. In July, she and Gordon drove up the coast and headed to Haight-Ashbury. I. Nineteen seventy-three was also the year that Flora Rheta Schreiber published Sybil, her explosive, controversial account of dissociative identity disorder (then known as multiple personality disorder). Acker never publicly mentioned the bestselling book, but it's interesting to note how she was exploring, in a much different way, related ideas around trauma, the formation of self, sexual abuse, and the malleability of memory. The writer Stephen Beachy touches briefly on this in his 2007 essay \"JT LeRoy and Narratives of Abuse,\" which compellingly situates the case of the fictional writer, JT LeRoy, against the backdrop of such books. Many figures in Acker's later circle, including Ira Silverberg, Dennis Cooper, and Eileen Myles, were duped by LeRoy's creator, Laura Albert. II. To the best of my knowledge, Graham has never spoken publicly about this fling with Acker. He never responded to my repeated interview requests. ",
  "15": "SAN FRANCISCO WAS A NEW city to Acker, but also a familiar and welcoming one. It had been a beacon for the Beats; home of San Francisco Renaissance poets like Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Duncan, and Jack Spicer; the cradle of both the New Age movement and the sex industry. An enormous gay and lesbian community flourished there\u2014the Daughters of Bilitis, whose dances Acker had attended in Manhattan, and their male counterpart, the Mattachine Society, had relocated there from Los Angeles in 1955. In 1969, there were fifty gay organizations in the city; by the time Acker and Gordon arrived, four years later, there were eight hundred. The Cockettes, an anarchic, gender-bending theater troupe that emerged out of a commune in the Haight, and which Acker often credited as an influence, had more or less disbanded by 1973, but their spirit lived on in the equally outrageous Angels of Light. \"Everyone goes around saying love all the time (really!!),\" she told Jackson Mac Low, \"it's like a cloud of nuttiness covers this city\u2026\" Acker and Gordon settled in the ground-floor apartment of a three-story Victorian at 46 Belvedere Street. The apartment had two separate parlors, with Acker using one as a writing room and Gordon using the other as a studio. Missing her cats, Acker replaced them with other animals: two hamsters, named Art and Revolution, and a pair of parakeets, Jackson Mac Low and John Cage. Around the corner were a few other friendly musicians, all of whom were loosely affiliated with Mills and all of whom had adopted their own winsome stage names: \"Blue\" Gene Tyranny, Clay Fear, Phil Harmonic, Rich Gold. They shared a house they dubbed the Honeymoon Hotel, and Gordon and Acker soon became close to them. It was an age of aliases. Aside from Lynn Hershman Leeson's Roberta Breitmore, San Francisco was also home to a Canadian mail artist named Anne Lee Long, who had refashioned herself as Anna Banana when she moved to the city and founded Vile magazine, a parody of General Idea's FILE, itself a parody of LIFE. Several months after Acker's arrival, a group of militant revolutionaries calling themselves the Symbionese Liberation Army, who had previously murdered Oakland school superintendent Marcus Foster, kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst from her Berkeley apartment. Two months later, Hearst claimed to have joined the group and changed her name to Tania. SLA leader Donald DeFreeze's nom de guerre was Field Marshal Cinque, and other members had aliases like Mizmoon and Yolanda. Acker's own appearance shifted frequently\u2014she'd grow her hair out a bit, then cut it very short again. Sometimes she wore lots of makeup, other times none. Gordon himself occasionally went around in drag, going by the name Art Povera. When Acker listed her name in the phone book, she used both The Black Tarantula and Rip-off Red. At first, life in San Francisco wasn't all that different from life in San Diego. \"Basically I eat, shit, fuck etc, read and write,\" she told Harris Schiff. To Mac Low, she was more effusive: \"Even tho I still haven't gotten over the jolt of entering another new environment, & that swirling in my head, I feel I can live here\u2026 artists are so open here.\" As always, though, money was extremely tight, especially as Gordon's father had by then stopped helping them out. Acker still refused to get a job\u2014\"I've made the final decision not to work unless the work concerns my writing, I'd rather starve\"\u2014and Gordon was compelled to support them both, taking various night and day jobs to do so while still attending classes at Mills. One of those night jobs was working at a porn bookstore, where Freilicher would cruise when he came up to visit. To save money, Gordon cut Acker's hair. She frequently skipped meals, preferring, she said, to use what little grocery money they had to pay for the printing and mailing of The Black Tarantula serials. Late that summer or early fall, for a payment of a hundred dollars, Acker agreed to do a new translation of Aristophanes's Lysistrata for a colleague of Rothenberg's named Charles Doria. She soon gave up, however, finding the play dull\u2014\"too much of it came off as women's lib cant which I guess I've heard too much of or something.\" She offered instead to translate another of Aristophanes's plays, Thesmophoriazusae, which she'd seen performed by the Angels of Light, and which tells of a group of Athenian women who plot to kill Euripides because of his misogyny. Acker also proposed including an introduction that would, in effect, be a meta-translation, accounting for both her research on Greek society of the period and her experience writing the translation: \"I have to translate autobiographically and that means including the ideas I read think express feel act on etc. that preceed [sic] my actual translation of words of play.\" At the end of an explanatory letter to Doria, she added a handwritten postscript: \"The obvious idea of Aristophanes: that politics should be determined by sexual and individual needs, not vice versa, is important to me.\" She included a copy of this introduction (\"a TARANTULA of ideas,\" she called it), which, in keeping with her writing from the period, juxtaposed frank, even miserable, descriptions of her daily life with snatches of, among others, Aristophanes, Plato, Yeats, and W. G. Forrest's The Emergence of Greek Democracy. What Doria thought of Acker's proposal is unknown, but it clearly wasn't what he, or his publisher, had bargained for. He would eventually publish an anthology of newly translated classic work in 1980 and Acker's Thesmophoriazusae would not be part of it. At the same time, she continued to produce new installments of The Childlike Life, turning out a new one every month or so. A third installment was titled \"i move to san francisco. i begin to copy my favorite pornography books and become the main person in each of them.\" Those pornography books included Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Isabelle, Violette Leduc's notorious tale of adolescent lesbian love, which Acker mashed up with half-remembered, half-fantasized scenes from Lenox. A fourth installment used The Carnal Days of Helen Seferis by Alexander Trocchi\u2014\"my favorite pornographer,\" she said of him, \"I've never seen a man so well understand female sexuality.\" In a fifth, she \"becomes\" Yeats. \"I'm trying to become other people because this is what I find interesting,\" she explains. \"I'm trying to get away from self-expression but not from personal life. I hate creativity. I'm simply exploring other ways of dealing with events than ways my lousy habits\u2014mainly installed by parents and institutions\u2014have forced me to act. At this point, I'm over-sensitive and have a hard time talking to anyone. I can fuck more easily.\" In the sixth and final installment, she immerses herself in the words and biography of the Marquis de Sade: \"sometimes I think he's horrible, sometimes I think he's great, but he always makes me question.\" On the last page of the typescript, Acker wrote \"This will be the last TARANTULA for a while,\" but by May 1974, she'd started making notes toward a follow-up she called I Dreamt I Was a Nymphomaniac!: Imagining. In a preview of the censorship Acker would run into later in her career, some printers refused to print the books because they found them morally offensive. More bothersome to her was the rejection of printer-publisher Noel Young, to whom Kenneth Rexroth had referred Acker. Young was the founder of Capra Press, a celebrated micro-publisher in Santa Barbara that published short, offbeat books by the likes of Henry Miller, Ray Bradbury, and Raymond Carver, and he felt Acker was simply not in their league (\"too green\"). Even worse than this, however, was the criticism she received from old friends like Bernadette Mayer and Harris Schiff. While Mac Low had praised the pamphlets\u2014\"the use of abstraction and philosophical self-analysis is brilliant\"\u2014Mayer had characterized them as polemical, boring, and didactic. Whatever Schiff's actual comments were\u2014they're lost to time\u2014they clearly stung too. In December, Acker wrote him a forceful defense that summed up her perspective and intentions:\n            If you have something to say about the TARANTULAS say it, and I'll reply if I think a reply's necessary. I basically don't care about criticism because I'm more interested in ideas than in whether I've said something nicely or whatever, but I'm really interested in talking about the ideas which are the TARANTULAS. Re: \"how come I write mainly about myself?\" and \"why don't I make up new people?\": I don't write mainly about myself though I use the word \"I\" rather than the second or third person. I use basically found material, material written by other people; about one fourth of the TARANTULAS, if that much contains autobiographical material. I'm interested in my relations to other people, my possibility of getting outside of myself. Since I'm interested in this as a real problem, I don't make up people, because then I'd still be dealing with only my own thoughts, I try to use the thoughts etc. of real people. I'm not interested in self-expression (perhaps you misunderstood some of the ideas, or I haven't been expressing them clearly enough)\u2026 If Acker was discouraged, that feeling didn't last for long. In Nymphomaniac, she doubled down on her ideas. Continuing her excavation of self, she still used diary material and still gave characters the names of her friends and lovers\u2014the title itself was a nod to Elly Antin's I Dreamt I Was a Ballerina. Peter Gordon appears as an SLA agent and \"the most gorgeous fag in town,\" sometimes male, sometimes female. \"I assured her I would never stand in the way of her work,\" Acker writes of this quasi-fictional Gordon. \"I mainly needed to be financially supported, left alone, fucked, told I'm a wonderful writer.\" Acker continues to shift abruptly between dream narratives, plundered passages from other books, and her own eccentric reimaging of current political crises like the Attica prison riots. In Nymphomaniac, though, she abandons the reader-friendly signposts she'd used in The Childlike Life: the parenthetical demarcation, the lists of plagiarized books that punctuated each installment. For astute readers, however, the source material was hardly hidden. Most apparent, perhaps, was Blaise Cendrars's 1926 novel Moravagine. An underground classic, the book chronicles the exploits of its titular anarchist and murderer, who, released from a hospital for the criminally insane by a sympathetic and obsessed psychiatrist, embarks on a global reign of atrocity, terror, and revolution. Cendrars, a name that was itself yet another pseudonym, argued that Moravagine was his double. \"What an incredible fucking writer he is,\" Acker said of Cendrars. \"The speed at which he goes!\" Acker transposed sections of the novel from Russia to an unruly, politically fraught America, renamed Moravagine for Gordon's teacher Bob Ashley, and substituted figures, like the anarchist Peter Kropotkin, with Patty Hearst. Just as she's been for many other writers, artists, and filmmakers, Hearst was a seductive subject for both Acker and Gordon. As with the Weathermen, the SLA's radicalism held an undeniable (if temporary) romantic charge. Acker and Gordon were intrigued by what Hearst's outlandish story said about racial politics, capitalism, the possibilities and limitations of revolutionary activity, and, as always, the refusal to be, in Acker's words, \"an enclosed individual.\" There was a material appeal too for Gordon. The SLA communicated their demands through cassette tapes that the group sent to local radio stations. Gordon recorded these communiqu\u00e9s and, in the studio, edited and blended Hearst's voice with those of friends like Tyranny and Phil Harmonic, who repeated her words. He called the piece \"Greetings from the SLA.\" The true subject of Nymphomaniac, however, was Acker's philosophical investigations, the concentrated representation of which was almost unheard of in American fiction, mainstream or otherwise. \"Ideas are most important,\" she told Mayer, \"don't cover over ideas with fancy writing.\" Still concerned with investigating or exploding an authorial \"I,\" she now wanted to see how memory and imagination shaped subjectivity. In a notebook, she mapped out, more or less, what she was trying to do in the book:\n                \n                    \n                        use myself changing as model for change. Change \u2192 changing memory (can't get rid of memory) but remembering concerns changing past in terms of present: present desire rel for future. Making this clear/find more about remembering in terms of changing myself \n                        what if imagining involves this time? what if repeated time becomes revolutionary?  Kubler was George Kubler, the art historian and author of The Shape of Time, a study of formal and symbolic ideas of duration. But Acker was also reading Sartre and the Austrian mathematician and philosopher Gustav Bergmann, whose knotty writings on ontology she found particularly useful. Nymphomaniac, unsurprisingly, was a more challenging project than The Childlike Life, \"a messier work on the whole,\" and more difficult to write. \"I was searching for something,\" Acker told an interviewer. But what? What did she hope these experiments would help her find? A way to process the painful memories of her childhood, or to determine which were true? (\"My first remembering is my desire not to perceive events as they are,\" she writes.) Or a way to, again, figure out who she was and what she really desired? (\"Intention: escape this horror as I know it and made by it. How can I (I being a model of any individual) change? Assume the relativist theory of time accurately maps time in the world. 'I change.' What do I mean by 'I'?\") Or was this just a way to make fiction that felt sufficiently rigorous, even revolutionary? (\"My mission is to reveal the uncertainties, unimportances, and final equivalents of all identities.\") All of the above, most likely. \"Why shouldn't writing be everything?\" she wrote to Mayer. But if Nymphomaniac was a more difficult book to write, it's also a more difficult book to read. It's often bewildering and occasionally muddled; Acker's refusal to revise gives it an often inhospitable shape. When Acker's work is described as \"raw,\" critics and readers are usually referring to the emotion and sex in her books, but here too, the overt philosophy could be called raw, or, at the very least, lightly processed. Mayer was right to call it dull, at least in parts. While Acker could, and does, subtly weave philosophical ideas into her work, large sections of Nymphomaniac are also clotted with chunks of academic deliberation that wouldn't be out of place in the grad school seminars she had recently fled:\n            I write down a certain number of words repeat those words again. Does the first unit of words mean the same as the repeated unit? That is, either events in time (as for time, for space) are isolated, or mutually dependent with regard to meaning not existence. (For a moment, skip the problem of meaning and existence.) If the meaning(s) of the writing events depend(s) at least partially on the temporal relations of the writing events, the relativist theory of time seems more accurate. In the book's most notorious sequence, Acker relates a dream that encompasses her family, the art world, and sex. The dream ends or fades out: \"As we're fucking, her boyfriend enters the room and stops us because we're not supposed to act sooo\" Then, the dream sequence begins again, word for word, concluding with the same fade-out. Like a musical refrain, she repeats it again, two more times, and the chapter ends. Such repetition occurs frequently throughout the first half of the book. \"I wanted to see if repeating would change things,\" she said. \"If time was basically made up of moments. If it was qualitative or quantitative.\" Also, perhaps, the repetition of moments, particularly the harrowing ones of her childhood, offered a chance to start over. Perhaps she had in mind again Gertrude Stein, who wondered if repetition existed, or whether it should just be called insistence? Acker shuffles subjects, ideas, and perspectives with the kind of speed that she admired in Cendrars, but then often slows down, and even runs aground, on the reef of her ruminations. Nonetheless, the novel would find fans among Language poets like Barrett Watten, whose essay, titled \"Foucault Reads Acker,\" describes Nymphomaniac as a \"liberationist text [which] records an undoing of self at a historical moment of political crisis that Acker wishes to perpetuate by textual means,\" and the New Narrative writer Robert Gl\u00fcck, both of whom would become close to Acker. Gl\u00fcck first stumbled across the book at the Small Press Traffic bookstore in San Francisco before he had ever heard of or met the writer. At first, he recoiled from Acker's refusal of readerly pleasure or even stability, then enthusiastically embraced her strategies: \"Rather than drawing conclusions, developing identifications or thematic connections, that is making judgements that lead to knowledge, Acker creates a reader who is lost in strangeness.\" For McKenzie Wark, who credits Acker with helping her transition from male to female, Acker's almost nonchalant insistence on gender fluidity in Nymphomaniac and her other books was literally life-changing: \"A mythic world opens in which genders and sexual orientations emerge together, mutate together, differentiate together.\" Though Acker described herself at the time as a \"bloody hermit,\" she ventured frequently into San Francisco's literary and art scenes. Most Tuesdays, she swung by Intersection, a performance and poetry space then located in an old Methodist church in North Beach. When the Empty Elevator Shaft, a print-shop-cum-bookstore in Noe Valley, started its own short-lived reading series, Acker attended that too and had some of her Black Tarantula serials printed there. As she finished additional installments, she continued to diligently disseminate them through her mailing list, while also taking them to bookstores like Berkeley's Sand Dollar, where she sold them on consignment. (Acker stayed in touch for decades with the Sand Dollar's owner, Jack Shoemaker, later the founder of the venerable North Point Press, publisher of Guy Davenport and Juan Goytisolo, among many others.) At least once a week, she also accompanied Gordon to Mills, where she became friendly with faculty like Robert Ashley (\"wonderful nice to me,\" she told Jerome Rothenberg). Ashley, then forty-three, was a renowned composer and creator of conceptual theater, sometimes called the greatest genius of twentieth-century opera. His enthusiasm was legendary, his innovations myriad, his influence on American musicians like Laurie Anderson and David Byrne profound. His most famous work was arguably 1983's Perfect Lives, a cryptic, sui generis television production that ostensibly chronicles two musicians staging a prank bank robbery in a small Midwestern town and which has been called variously the first American opera, a performance novel, and a magpie nest of language. Though no fan of opera herself, Acker later credited Ashley with showing her how to create writing that was more of an \"environment\" rather than centralized, meaningful narrative\u2014a \"de-narrative,\" she called it. At one point, she and Ashley contemplated writing a movie together (\"a saga about the Midwestern U.S., of sorts, and the pathology of everyday living\"), a project which, alas, never came to fruition. In a letter to Bernadette Mayer, Acker wrote that her male \"art stars\" were Ashley, Gordon, Lawrence Weiner, and David Antin; the female ones were Mayer and Elly Antin. (Dan Graham was \"on outs.\") When Acker and Gordon first arrived in San Francisco, they started hosting a weekly three-hour show on KPOO, a local community radio station. The couple were told they could do whatever they wanted, and they did, with Acker reading work by Antin, Mac Low, de Sade, or her own writing. Gordon played music by the likes of Arthur Honegger, invited Ashley and Terry Riley on as guests. \"I don't know if anyone listens,\" Acker wrote to Mac Low, \"but it's fun.\" Soon, however, they learned the station's managers were not quite as permissive as they had first thought. At some point on-air, Acker told a story about how she lost her virginity, and on another occasion, Gordon had Ashley present a talking piece. The first violated FCC regulations; the latter KPOO deemed too boring. The show was dropped. \"It was very repressive and very demeaning,\" Gordon told the Berkeley Barb at the time. A few months later, though, they debuted another show on Berkeley's KPFA, the first listener-supported broadcaster in the country. High Art in Its Highest Glory was essentially proto-talk radio, a three-hour program during which Acker and Gordon (and later Ashley) would chat about various topics and ideas, then take calls from listeners, who could talk about whatever they wanted. Gordon mixed and layered the various voices, creating an alluring soundscape. Acker, Gordon recalled, \"had no filter.\" At one point, someone with whom she'd been having an affair called in, and they broke up on the air. Soon enough, they received an admonishing letter from the station's program director, and that show was canceled too. Gordon's cohort at Mills was tiny and tight-knit, and he quickly befriended a classmate named Jill Kroesen, who also went by the stage name Fay Shism. Kroesen was a lissome, dark-haired musical daredevil who, like Gordon, mingled rock and pop with avant-garde experimentation. Her MFA thesis at Mills was built around a song she composed, \"Fay Shism Blues,\" which reimagined Hitler as a femme fatale. Gordon performed on that, and the pair would collaborate frequently over the next few years, including on Ashley's Perfect Lives. Kroesen loved Gordon, calling him years later \"the greatest guy in the universe.\" Her feelings toward Acker were more complex. While acknowledging that Acker was smart and charismatic, she also thought that Acker \"didn't care about other people's feelings at all,\" and Kroesen never found her particularly friendly. This might have had something to do with the fact that Kroesen and Gordon ended up sleeping together. It was a fling, and only lasted a couple of weeks, but as Gordon had learned by that point, Acker's attitudes toward monogamy didn't exactly extend to her partners\u2014she could be extremely possessive. Kroesen also had a difficult time with Acker's writing. She had endured her own \"horrible\" childhood, had been sexually abused, in fact, and found any violent or pornographic art extremely upsetting. She was amazed that Acker would willingly revisit her own childhood memories in her books. \"In her work, it was like she was running like a mad person away from the pain,\" Kroesen said, \"but leaving this trail of information to figure it out.\" Still, Kroesen was captivated enough by Acker to write several songs about her over the next couple of years, ditties both affectionate and acerbic, like \"Don't Steal My Boyfriend,\" \"Please Don't Hurt Me,\" \"Lenny and Kathy,\" and \"Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Blues.\" \"Prince Charming Blues,\" which Kroesen dedicated to Acker, borrowed a refrain from the Rolling Stones' \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\" sandwiching it between verses like \"I had a boy with a penis as long as a kitchen knife/When he tried to fuck me I thought I'd lose my life/I left him for a gorgeous man whose prick was short and fat/But oh my god he comes too fast.\" Kroesen, who was also a talented graphic artist, ended up designing a cover for the first printed edition of The Childlike Life\u2014a collage with a stylized spider splayed over Acker's face. Acker never really cared for it, and ditched the image in all subsequent editions. As Gordon became intimate with Kroesen, Acker continued to seek out her own extracurricular romances. \"Lots of street sex, bang, bang, bang,\" she told Mac Low. For a while, she had a standing weekly liaison with Honeymoon Hotel resident Rich Gold, and there were other brief encounters, including a one-night stand with the poet-novelist Andrei Codrescu. In February 1974, she embarked on an affair of more lasting significance with the conceptual artist and writer Alan Sondheim. The relationship was fraught and, from the start, bound up in Acker's messy family history. That month she flew to New York to collect a small trust fund that her maternal grandfather had left her: $300 in cash, as well as an additional hundred dollars' worth of stock dividends. As Acker told it, this money had been kept secret from her, with her parents forging her signature and keeping the dividends for themselves. How exactly Acker learned about the trust is unclear, but what made its existence even more dramatic was the fact that the check was made out to someone named Karen Lehman. Here, at last, was her actual birth name. Her biological father, she had finally discovered, was someone named Harry Lehman, Jr. She learned that he was the scion of the family that founded the Buffalo-based Wildroot Company, a hugely successful purveyor of hair tonics, shampoos, and other products. (Ronald Reagan appeared in their advertisements; Colgate-Palmolive bought the company in 1959.) Acker was stunned and disoriented. At long last, at twenty-six years of age, she was close to tracking down her real father. Or was she? While she suddenly had the information she'd long sought, she didn't quite know what to do with it. What did she want from this father she had never known, and who supposedly hadn't wanted her? The discovery briefly paralyzed her. While she would travel to New York and briefly visit Claire and Bud, she wouldn't, it seems, actively try to find Lehman for over a year. Instead, as she'd been doing her whole writing life, she'd once again transmute his abandonment into art. On February 18, she read at the Poetry Project alongside Mel Freilicher and Ed Bowes. Alan Sondheim was in the audience. Sondheim was five years older than Acker, thin and nebbishy, with a nimbus of thick, dark hair. He was a prolific polymath who'd already produced a thicket of book-length essays, spoken-word performances, and experiments with new technology, and Acker, who'd heard about his work through David Antin, was curious about him. A couple days after the reading, she had dinner with him and his wife, Beth Cannon, at their apartment on 17th Street, where Acker said, they \"talked for twelve hours.\" Acker returned to San Francisco a couple days later, but their connection was intense, and they decided, over the course of several letters and phone calls, that they would make a videotape together \"exploring sexuality.\" Sondheim scrounged some money from the Rhode Island School of Design, where he was a guest artist, recruited a student named Emily Cheng to operate the camera, and flew Acker back to New York at the beginning of March. At his apartment, they ended up making two tapes, though the second one, a satire of the first\u2014an \"inverse, both sexually and in terms of mood,\" in Sondheim's words\u2014was lost for several decades. The first, however, became a small sensation. Over the course of fifty-four black-and-white minutes, Acker and Sondheim engage in a kind of dispassionate verbal jousting, trying to define both themselves and their relationship to each other. Or, more accurately perhaps, perform this act of definition. Acker's hair is buzzed short, and she's wearing rimless glasses, dangly earrings, a dark cotton scarf around her neck. They talk haughtily about control, about perception, about power. With Lehman fresh in her mind, Acker says she regards Sondheim as a father figure\u2014her \"perfect father\"\u2014or as a kind of analyst, using him to get to memories that were too painful for her to access any other way. Sondheim, for his part, thought Acker was his \"soulmate.\" He calls her a \"powerful person,\" and says, to Acker's evident delight, \"You're gonna kill people, baby, you really are.\" Much of their conversation, however, or their respective monologues, occurs as they are having actual sex. Cheng's camera captures, with intermittent focus, Sondheim stroking Acker's clit and her rimming him and sucking him off while he struggles to narrate his thoughts and sensations. Sondheim later remembered Acker acting \"suicidal\" during a break in the taping, though Cheng only remembers Acker's self-confidence and her \"utter lack of self-consciousness with her body and emotions.\" Chris Kraus situated the tape in the lineage of confrontational conceptual art that included Vito Acconci's Seedbed and Chris Burden's Shoot, but the overall effect is something like an early Chantal Akerman film rewritten by Woody Allen. \"We pushed things as far as we could,\" Sondheim later wrote. \"I felt needy. I hated myself.\" The tape was later shown at St. Mark's, Yale, RISD, and the Whitney, among other places, titillating, amusing, and repelling its various audiences. Eventually, Acker and Sondheim agreed not to show the tape without their mutual consent; they both considered the experiment a failure. Acker never talked publicly about the two tapes, and only rarely, as she became a better-known writer, did she ever mention Sondheim. It seemed she would have preferred the whole experience be forgotten. But over the years, the first tape, which was never formally titled, became known as The Blue Tape and, when it was rediscovered a few years after Acker's death, took on the aura of an archaeological treasure. It was a glum artifact of the New York art world in the early seventies, with its dubious gender dynamics, sexual gamesmanship, and intellectual braggadocio on full display. You can practically smell the bodies. The emotional vulnerability, performative or not, is oppressive. For Acker devotees, however, it was a rare, unedited glimpse of her charm and difficulty, and, above all, the lengths she would go in the name of self-determination and knowledge. ",
  "16": "THE RELATIONSHIP WITH SONDHEIM WAS intense and destabilizing, but it died down as quickly as it had flared up. By that summer, Acker had become disenchanted, calling him \"a shit\" and \"a schmuck.\" She'd also found a different focus for her romantic energies. At the Empty Elevator Shaft, where he was giving a reading with Barrett Watten, she met Ron Silliman, a poet whom David Antin had suggested she look up. Silliman was about a year older than her, and had been raised in Albany, California, just north of Berkeley. Then, and throughout his career, Silliman moved between quite different spheres\u2014after registering as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, he worked for the Committee for Prisoner Humanity and Justice while also writing and publishing several books, organizing readings himself, and serving as executive editor of the Socialist Review. Silliman became one of the best-known Language poets, a group of formally adventurous poets in the Bay Area and New York whose name was derived from the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E journal edited by Bruce Andrews and Charles Bernstein. The Language poets, as the Acker scholar Georgina Colby usefully defines them, rejected the \"processural\" poetics of Charles Olson, which had once influenced Acker, and \"attacked the instrumental value of language put forward and sustained by a capitalist society.\" Their number included Rae Armantrout, Clark Coolidge, Carla Harryman, Bob Perelman, Hannah Weiner, and Lyn Hejinian, among others. Silliman's essay \"The New Sentence,\" published in 1977, was a landmark Language manifesto and he remains one of the movement's most compelling, if controversial, theorists. In 2002, Silliman started a popular blog, which quickly became a vital, comprehensive online repository of innovative American poetry. At their first meeting, Acker handed him the latest installment of Nymphomaniac. Silliman was impressed. It was clear that she was writing fiction, not poetry, and while Silliman was a self-professed snob about novels\u2014why would you want to write one of those, he wondered\u2014he was delighted by the foundational questions she was asking about fiction-making. \"She was really trying to figure out, 'What is a character?' 'How do you make a character?' 'How does a character acquire a voice or is it the voice that generates the character?' 'How do you get a character through the door given that the door is simply an imagined construct?' She tore fiction down to its very core.\" He found it quaint and somewhat romantic too that she was writing her book, or books, one installment a month, and he found himself deliberately going to readings hoping to bump into her and get the next one. They would eventually sleep together, but she'd always value him more as a friend and confidant. Her appearance and contradictory affect beguiled him. She was the first woman he'd seen in San Francisco with hair so short, but he loved her \"good smile,\" and thought she made a point of being attractive and off-putting all at once. Despite her \"very hard-edged physical presentation,\" and unlike just about every other poet and visual artist he knew, who lived in predictable bohemian squalor, he thought she valued what he called \"a positive, supportive environment around the house.\" (On Belvedere, that meant old-school comfy hippie trappings: a waterbed, plenty of printed cloth, the pets with their amusing names.) The attraction went both ways. Silliman appears frequently as a character in The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec by Henri Toulouse Lautrec, the third and final Black Tarantula book, where an Acker alter-ego named Giannina calls him \"my closest friend in San Francisco.\" They started going to readings together, taking the Geary Street bus and then disembarking at a mutually convenient intersection where they would stand and talk and flirt for hours. She was one of the few people he knew in the poetry scene, maybe the only one, who was also interested in what was going on in art and electronic music, and she sometimes took him to those events. For the final section of Nymphomaniac, she took some documents that Silliman had from his job at the Committee for Prisoner Humanity and Justice, lifting its bureaucratic catalogue of penal procedures and grievances, substituting inmate's names with those of her friends, and essentially publishing it verbatim. On one occasion, Silliman and Acker were invited to read together at a restaurant on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley. It was an important reading for Silliman, the public debut of the first section of his book-length poem Ketjak, but Acker, with precocious aplomb, decided she wouldn't read at all. Instead, she had Gordon, Rich Gold, and Phil Harmonic go up on stage and instructed them to talk about what The Black Tarantula was like as a lover. \"I think Kathy had something more salacious in mind,\" Silliman remembered, \"but they were all perfect gentlemen. They all recounted what she had told them to talk about, but they were really not going to talk about their love lives with her.\" Nonetheless, and with no hard feelings, Silliman quickly realized that he'd been upstaged by Acker's \"marvelous sense of self-mythologization and theater.\" Acker would soon abandon such stunts, but her readings would always be characterized by that sense of theater. She treated every reading as a real performance, and she deliberately avoided the expected. If there was a microphone, she might not use it. If there was a lectern, she'd stand in front of it or sit on the stage. At the Western Front in Vancouver, whose performance space used church pews for seating, Acker told the audience that she didn't want anyone to sit in the pews, but rather to come up and sit on the floor with her. \"I'm a performance artist,\" she said, \"I'm not going to just read from my book.\" Lynne Tillman, the novelist and critic, first saw Acker read in New York in the late seventies, and remembered one occasion, at a now forgotten restaurant on Third Avenue. Acker sat on a table in the middle of the room, with people all sitting around her. She pressed her mouth against the mic, whispering \"sinisterly,\" an effect enhanced by the fact that she was reading about people who were in the same room. \"She did what she wanted to do,\" said Tillman of Acker's reading style. \"She took these great liberties.\" Inspired by that particular event, Tillman started working on a novella she called Weird Fucks. Many other writers, including Dennis Cooper, Leslie Dick, and Kevin Killian, claimed that Acker taught them how to read their own work in public. \"If she thought she was losing her audience,\" Killian said, \"instead of speeding up, as you have a tendency to do as you're up there dying, she would slow down to a crawl. The audience, even if they're bored, says, 'Am I missing something?' and they really focus in on her. She would just do it until she had every last person in the room. No matter what part of the story it was. It was a trick I learned for the rest of my life.\" In their novel, Inferno, Eileen Myles similarly captures Acker reading in Germany late in her life: \"Each of us was to read for 8 or 10 minutes and Kathy would read for 21. And miraculously she didn't kill the room. I'd watch her going on and on same fucking story. I'd think how can she do this. Deadly. But she was okay. More than that. People were riveted.\" As Acker's career started to take off, Gordon was also moving on to more lucrative creative pastures. While still enrolled at Mills, he began playing sax in a band called Butch Whacks and the Glass Packs, a \"50s rock-and-roll genre revue\" that toured North America, sometimes opening for the likes of the Doobie Brothers. During a three-week stint at the Cave in Vancouver, in an ardent, lonely letter, Gordon told Acker about his increasing musical confidence. \"It's strange,\" he wrote, \"I could be big in rock if I worked at it. It's really a matter of getting into the drag.\" That drag would only fit for a short while, though, and he stayed with the band for just six months. Acker had little patience for that particular scene, burrowing instead into her own work. She gave a reading with the poet Jim Carroll at Intersection that November, kept working on Nymphomaniac. Writing the book was exhausting, though, and she found distraction reading Bertolt Brecht and playing with her animals. By that point, Jill Kroesen had moved to New York, and Acker was starting to think that maybe she should return to the East Coast again too. \"I now need the input,\" she told Mac Low. Though she still loved Gordon, she said, their sex life was nonexistent, and it often felt like they were on the verge of or in the midst of a real breakup. Acker asked Bernadette Mayer if she could arrange a reading for her at St. Mark's, and after some back-and-forth, Acker booked a flight to New York to coincide with the opening of an Eleanor Antin gallery show in mid-January 1975. Around the same time, Gordon would be in Chicago, where the Glass Packs had a three-week residency at the Playboy Club. Just before Acker was to leave, though, in December, she received an unexpected letter from Ted Castle and Leandro Katz, the founders of the Vanishing Rotating Triangle Press (TVRT), a tiny New York\u2013based purveyor of poetry by the likes of John Ashbery, C\u00e9sar Vallejo, and Gerard Malanga. They had been on the Black Tarantula mailing list and wanted to reprint The Childlike Life in a TVRT edition. Katz admired \"the leaps of language\" in Acker's work and likened her appropriations to the pastiches in the outrageous plays Charles Ludlam produced with his Ridiculous Theatrical Company. Acker was excited by the offer, but wrote back saying her \"old stuff seems dead to me\" and tried to persuade them instead to publish a new Rip-off Red book titled I Become a Revolutionary. Castle and Katz stuck to their initial plan, however, and while TVRT editions normally had miniscule print runs\u2014three hundred copies or so\u2014The Childlike Life would be their largest production to date, about a thousand. It would be a loose arrangement, though; TVRT bought no rights and would pay Acker only in copies of the book. Still, they were a legitimate publishing house, and Acker was understandably elated. \"This was special,\" Gordon recalled. \"They were her first publishers.\"I Arriving in Manhattan that January, Acker quickly realized that Castle and Katz weren't her only fans. She now had a certain notoriety in downtown art and literary circles. In a letter to Silliman, she wrote, \"in SF I thought no one gave a shit about my books here I'm some kind of star.\" Or, for better or worse, The Black Tarantula was. An aura of mystery, danger, and sexual aggression clung to the pen name. Eileen Myles, freshly arrived at St. Mark's themselves, recalled that the Poetry Project was abuzz about \"the legend of The Black Tarantula.\" At one point, the poet Bill Berkson tried to pick Acker up, telling her that he'd read her writing and knew \"what she wanted.\" \"My books made everyone think I'm Ms. Cunt,\" she told Silliman, her dismay colored by an irrefutable pride. Acker would always be equivocal about fame: craving it on the one hand (\"that was her goal,\" Gordon said), but frustrated that she couldn't completely control how it affected her work and life. Even later, as she more strenuously stage-managed her public image, it always threatened to undermine how seriously her writing was taken, or obscure it completely. If Acker was becoming an underground star, like many an underground star she was also still broke and alone, with nowhere, really, to live. She ended up crashing at Mayer's apartment on Second Avenue for more than a month. It was a somewhat fraught arrangement to begin with, given Mayer's regard for Acker's recent writing and complicated further by Mayer's own domestic dramas (she'd had an affair the previous summer with Anne Waldman and was now involved with Waldman's ex-husband, Lewis Warsh). Acker was also now between books, somewhat bored with both herself and her writing. Her first week back, looking for some other artistic outlet, she started attending workshops with Simone Forti, a pioneer of postmodern dance. She was soon consumed by the work. It felt good to be out of her head, working with her body, and she supplemented these classes with ones taught by Trisha Brown and Kenneth King, until she was dancing about five hours a day. In one of Forti's classes, she met Pooh Kaye, a twenty-four-year-old dancer, choreographer, and filmmaker, and also Acker's cousin. (While growing up, Acker had known Pooh by her birth name, Louise, and it would be years before they realized they were related.) Kaye had just graduated from Cooper Union and was then making a series of Super 8 films in which she performed, nude, a series of task-like dance movements in a variety of environments. They became close, and, for a while, Kaye idolized Acker. \"I was trying to figure out what I was doing,\" she recalled, \"but I was pretty unformed compared to someone like Kathy.\" They went to openings and parties together\u2014dancer and artist parties being better than dull poet parties\u2014hung out at places like the Locale on Waverly, which Mickey Ruskin opened after departing Max's Kansas City. After staying with Mayer, and before she found her own place, Acker couch-surfed all over downtown. She went from staying in Richard \"Rip\" Hayman's apartment above the Ear Inn, a beloved literary-minded dive in the lower Village, to living in the Spring Street loft owned by Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles, which Kaye occasionally cleaned to pay the bills. Acker told Silliman that Kaye was her \"best girlfriend,\" but soon, she had also befriended another female writer whose work hewed closer to Acker's own. Constance DeJong was working on her first novel, Modern Love, which she would also start serializing that fall in five installments (and to a mailing list of five hundred) out of the Westbeth office of Performing Artservices, Inc., a nonprofit artists' management firm founded by Bob Ashley's wife, Mimi Johnson. DeJong, who was dating composer Philip Glass at the time, and who would write the libretto for his Satyagraha, was also keenly interested in the performance of her writing and would later become renowned for readings where she recited her prose from memory. Modern Love was elliptical and dissonant, part detective story, part postmodern historical romance, both a downtown cousin of Renata Adler's Speedboat and an American version of the nouveau roman. DeJong lived near Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, and she and Acker began meeting regularly for coffee and to talk shop. They were very different people, with very different backgrounds and personalities. DeJong was less social, more reserved, but she spent most of her time with composers and performers, and was delighted to find another prose writer with whom to discuss technical aspects of the form\u2014verb tenses, narrative construction, and the like. \"It was not a conversation I had with anyone else,\" she remembered. \"We were people of language and people of words.\" DeJong thought Acker's \"polyphonic voice\" was entirely unique, that she was \"doing things with language that other people had not done.\" She was equally impressed with how devotional Acker was to her writing. \"She was a dead-serious person. Writing was everything. And she was always working. It wasn't as boring as, 'Oh, she had a work ethic.' It was much more driven than that\u2014she was an extremely driven person.\" Acker similarly gushed about DeJong to Silliman: \"an incredible writer [who] I feel I can learn a lot from her writing it's incredibly precise i.e. so transparent.\" They shared their respective literary enthusiasms (Acker: Burroughs, Genet; DeJong: Stein, Duras, late Woolf), and at one meeting, Acker gave DeJong a copy of Violette Leduc's gossipy, self-abnegating memoir Mad in Pursuit. DeJong could see immediately what Acker had gleaned from the French writer\u2014\"the relentless voice of the struggling, self-obsessed Leduc persona, hyperbolizing her encounters.\" Acker and DeJong were united as well in their opposition to what, decades later, DeJong called \"the gatekeepers\" of commercial publishing. \"Kathy and I were like, 'Fuck the gatekeepers.' The gatekeepers of what? Some old-fashioned idea of what the novel is? I know I wasn't going to seek that approval or wait for it. I was acquainted, as was Kathy, with a number of artists who were older than we were and who were very can-do people very good at finding a way to have visibility. The music people did that. The dance people did that. The film people did that. Steve Reich and Philip Glass were not waiting for Lincoln Center to come calling. They went out into the world.\" The world those artists went to, or more often ushered into being themselves, was a rapidly expanding array of artist-run centers, performance spaces, and nightclubs that bloomed throughout the drear hothouse of 1970s lower Manhattan. Nineteen seventy-five was the year that New York officially teetered into economic chaos, when President Gerald Ford famously told the city to \"drop dead,\" denying it federal bailout money. It was, as DeJong writes in Modern Love, \"a city lost and beaten and full of emptiness.\" But the ubiquity of massive, cheap work spaces, lack of police and bureaucratic oversight, and a seemingly insatiable hunger for artistic collaboration led to an unprecedented surge of cultural activity. It helped too that the art world was relatively small and concentrated\u2014a grungy, scrambling, and interbred village. \"There are two hundred thousand artists in New York now,\" Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer said. \"Then there were two hundred. The news went very fast.\" The Kitchen, a performance and video art space, had opened in 1971 in the literal former kitchen of the Mercer Arts Center and by 1974 had moved to its own digs at Wooster and Broome streets in SoHo. Richard Foreman, the legendary experimental playwright and impresario, formed his own theater in a narrow loft at Broadway and Broome. Burgeoning institutions like the Franklin Furnace, Artists Space, Printed Matter, the Franklin Street Arts Center, and the Institute for Art and Urban Resources (later P.S.1), all of which opened their doors around the same period, provided emerging and alternative artists with money, company, and a home. With some excitement, Acker told Silliman about 112 Greene Street, a six-story, 24/7, art laboratory-cum-gallery created by artist Gordon Matta-Clark and a sculptor and self-described anarchist named Jeffrey Lew: \"this guy named Jeffrey Lew is setting up a downtown Lincoln Center one floor of which will be devoted to printing & he's promised Connie [Constance DeJong] she will have full control of the printing press which means I can too.\" While formerly desolate SoHo was being transformed and redefined by visual artists in the mid-seventies, the denser and more impoverished East Village and Lower East Side, meanwhile, nurtured a more literary and theatrical pedigree. As Alan Moore and Jim Cornwell put it in Alternative Art New York, those neighborhoods constituted a \"poet's district\u2026 thick with the forms and attitudes of previous cultural moments.\" In other words, as Edmund White wrote of the period, \"Then, there were only possibilities.\" Those possibilities would later be mythologized to the point of clich\u00e9, but many of the artists who imagined them, who nurtured them, who lived through them, do nonetheless recall the time with affection. \"It was such a playground,\" Pooh Kaye said of the city. \"It was so bankrupt, so formless. Anybody could put their own ambitions on top of it. You could make art anywhere.\" Lynne Tillman, who had just returned from several years in Europe and would soon befriend Acker too, was similarly intoxicated. \"I think we are all very interested in what was happening at that moment,\" she said. \"There was a lot going on. There was a lot of stuff to go to see. There was a lot of loft parties. There was a collision of people downtown.\" With New York largely broke too, the market didn't really dictate what kind of work was being made; there was no real market, no pie to fight over. Artists woke up, had an idea, then grabbed their like-minded friends and cobbled together enough resources to make it. Then they moved on to the next thing. The writer Lucy Sante summed it all up perfectly: \"1975 is a new world, somehow [\u2026] the year is a laboratory.\" Acker, for her part, was of two minds about all this. \"There never was a better time,\" she said, with genuine nostalgia, many years later. \"The community was absolutely strong. All my friendships have really come from that time.\" But in the moment, she alternated between enthusiasm and revulsion for the scene. She found the attention she personally received both thrilling and confusing, and she wasn't quite sure how to navigate the social dynamics of the art world. The male artists, whom she often derided as macho cowboys, were sexually aggressive. Though many people were interested in her work, she didn't always feel that enthusiastic about theirs. To her mind, artists like Vito Acconci were more or less over, and the new art that she was seeing in SoHo\u2014the gallery stuff, at least\u2014was tepid: \"none of it dangerous or with any social implications.\" She also claimed to hate the overweening competition of the art scene, what she called \"the Protestant work ethic, the real a-political coldness of the artists.\" But even she knew this was disingenuous. After just a short time back in New York, she had become even more conscious of the art world's hierarchies, the shifting strata of cultural capital, and how this shaped both the content and reception of art. Acker herself gleefully participated in this pecking order. She and Mel Freilicher \"graded\" the St. Mark's poets as A, B, C, or D and, at one point, even wrote out a flow chart detailing how these people could help them become famous. \"It involved befriending (sucking up to) x-number of A-list people,\" Freilicher remembered. \"You were allowed\u2014even required to\u2014alienate a small number of people on the B- and C-lists but only after fulfilling A-list requirements. It was a lot of fun.\" Acker also worked just as hard as anyone else, probably harder. It was a matter of \"survival,\" though, she told Silliman. \"Here art is ART WORK IMPORTANT. There ain't nothing else.\" Where else was she going to go, though? There weren't a lot of places for a writer like her. She told Silliman he should move there. And then, she went and got an actual job. Taking tickets a couple nights a week at the Kitchen, she made $15 a week. It was, she said, \"about the only job I've ever had that I like.\" I. With Printed Matter, TVRT later copublished different editions of both The Childlike Life and Toulouse Lautrec, with covers created by Katz and William Wegman, respectively. Katz believed the arrangement was the result of an affair between Acker and Sol LeWitt, a cofounder of Printed Matter, a rumor almost impossible to substantiate. (I asked Lawrence Weiner, who knew LeWitt well, and he could neither deny nor confirm, saying only that \"Sol was a Don Juan and Kathy had round heels.\") In any case, TVRT received no compensation from this collaboration, and Katz felt that Acker never cared enough to intervene on TVRT's behalf. Because of this rift, he wouldn't speak to her for years. ",
  "17": "GORDON VISITED NEW YORK IN February, but returned to California soon after; he'd continue to go back and forth while he toured and finished up his MFA. At some point, he and Acker had officially broken up, but they would still remain a couple, sharing an apartment again many months later. Acker was pleased with herself, though, that she hadn't, as she'd done in the past, immediately traded one heavy relationship for another. She was still meeting and getting involved with people\u2014for sex, for company, for connections\u2014but none of these relationships really had the intensity or drama of her previous ones. While still living at Mayer's, Acker hooked up with a twenty-three-year-old musician named Rhys Chatham, who also worked at Tin Pan Alley, a Times Square bar popular with jazz musicians, strippers, and artists, and was the Kitchen's first musical director. Chatham first met Acker at St. Mark's and was, like others, initially cowed by The Black Tarantula's fearsome reputation. While he soon got over this first impression, calling Acker in hindsight \"an absolute sweetheart,\" he remained somewhat shocked by what he considered her libertinism. Even in an era of unbridled sexual promiscuity, Chatham felt that she \"really did sleep with everyone,\" and had a particular fondness, he said, for younger men like himself. At the time, Acker was still, for better or worse, largely dependent on Gordon for financial and emotional support, both of which allowed her to write, but Chatham thought she also required fresh infusions of romantic adventure to fuel her work. \"She was a poet,\" he said. \"When she fell in love with one person or another, she was inspired to write.\" Her female friends, who were sometimes collateral damage in her carnal pursuits, were more curt. They didn't care that she slept around\u2014that was practically a given in their circles\u2014but they didn't appreciate her open disregard for their feelings or attachments. \"She slept with every man I knew,\" Pooh Kaye said. \"She'd co-opt people's boyfriends, husbands, lovers, anyone they had crushes on. It was a thing she did. At a party, she went after a guy I was interested in right in front of my face. It was unreal.\" Another friend, the artist Aline Mare, who was dating sculptor Richard Serra at the time, had a similar recollection: \"I'd see her at parties, where she just zoomed in on someone. It didn't matter if they came in together, and they were obviously a team. She would just direct her sexual and intellectual prowess. Like an animal, almost.\" Even the poet Eileen Myles, then still, in their words, \"actively heterosexual,\" experienced Acker this way. \"For several years,\" Myles said, \"I was fucking people who Kathy had just fucked.\" One night, the two of them were at Arcadia, a pizza joint frequented by the poetry crowd, sitting in a booth with two men. Myles, who was relatively friendly with Acker, recalled her refusing to even meet Myles's gaze, essentially treating Myles as if they weren't there. Acker wasn't particularly enraptured by Chatham\u2014\"he's more idiotic and childish and selfish than me,\" she told Silliman, \"[though] we get along well\"\u2014but she did scribble this note to herself on the back cover of the first notebook she used for The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec by Toulouse Lautrec: \"Reality: I admire Rhys because he has power\u2026 I don't fall in love w/ men just who are nice to me. Power = able to survive.\" What power did Chatham possess, in her mind? A sexual power? Perhaps she meant the cultural and social capital he had, owing to his role at the Kitchen and his growing reputation in the downtown music scene. As Chatham had divined, several of Acker's relationships, as is the case with so many ambitious people, had been driven, and would continue to be driven, by how useful a lover could be to her. Or how they helped her discover and cultivate different parts of herself. Ron Silliman concurred: \"It was clear that she really treated sexual relationships, instrumentally, career-wise.\" Power and sex too were inextricable for her. \"I think they were utterly connected in her mind,\" said her friend Betsy Sussler, the editor of BOMB magazine. A few months after her relationship with Chatham began, Acker would watch filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow, a close acquaintance when the latter was in the graduate film program at Columbia, publicly pursue the older French intellectual Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy at a Semiotext(e) event. When a somewhat appalled Acker asked her why, Bigelow smiled and said, \"Power, baby, power.\" It was a story that Acker loved to tell, though rarely, if ever, acknowledging that she might also be talking about herself. \"She was a skilled tactician around power,\" Eileen Myles said. \"That's what she was interested in.\" Sussler, who during their friendship found Acker heartbreakingly lonely and vulnerable, thought that Acker's relationship to, or understanding of, power was more complicated than that, particularly when it came to her sex life. \"She wanted to be sublimated, subsumed and consumed,\" Sussler said, \"and yet she wanted to have power over [men]. She wasn't a femme fatale.\" As all this testimony suggests, sex was of profound, complicated, and sometimes confusing importance to Acker, and would remain so for the rest of her life. On the one hand, her fascination was crude and simple\u2014as she would put it, she really liked to get fucked. And she could become bored quickly by her lovers. But it didn't end there. As literary territory, sex was incredibly rich, a limitless zone within which she could theorize about bodies, desire, performance, affect. Sex was her favorite topic, she said, describing herself as a \"fanatic.\" It contained both narrative\u2014expectation, tension, release\u2014and poetry\u2014seduction, rhythm, fluidity. Its pleasures could be transcendent and its disappointments crippling, a dialectic that Acker never tired of revisiting. It was also, finally, the corporeal expression of love\u2014irrational love, fascistic love, devotional love\u2014which never stopped being her great subject. \"These writings are the fuels of love,\" she wrote in My Death My Life by Pier Paolo Pasolini. \"Each statement is the absolute truth\u2014and an absolute lie\u2014because I'm always changing.\" Acker's love life, at many points, could seem almost indiscriminate. Her lovers were formidable intellectuals and accomplished artists, but just as often they were feckless poets, sycophantic students, and middle-of-the-road journalists. Physical attractiveness wasn't always a big deal to her either; some friends thought she had terrible taste. Boyfriends, husbands, and lovers were useful as material. In almost all her books, Acker includes figures based on real people, with various degrees of fidelity. Acker, however, never pretended that her characters were anything more than textual playthings, configurations in a composition within which to situate ideas or simulate voices, reliable shorthand to specific emotional effects. In some cases, these characters bore little more than their real-life analog's name; at other times, they were lightly drawn facsimiles. Silliman became a character in The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec, as did Chatham. Chatham was delighted to be used in such a manner, but Silliman had a somewhat more complex reaction. He first thought that Acker's description of him as \"gentle\" was, for her, an insult. Years later, though, re-reading lines like \"Ron's a great poet: His varied sensuous language reflects and questions itself,\" he would come to see how affectionate this thumbnail portrait was. \"She made me out to be a better person than I was,\" Silliman said. Acker started Toulouse Lautrec in May, around the same time TVRT was publishing The Childlike Life. The new book was less about herself, or about Acker trying to excavate herself, as human being, text, or author, and more about an exploration of genre and \"myth.\" Throughout Acker's career, \"myth\" would be a complex, mercurial word in her vocabulary but which mainly meant a kind of overarching discourse or narrative. Aside from Silliman, Chatham, and, again, Peter Gordon, the book teems with historical, real-life figures: the titular disfigured French painter; Van Gogh; Jacqueline Onassis; James Dean; Janis Joplin; Henry Kissinger. Dean, according to Acker, represented the \"myth\" of the 1950s, Joplin the '60s, and Kissinger the '70s. It also churns through several familiar narrative modes and styles\u2014art history, Agatha Christie mystery, fable, porn, Hollywood film, tabloid newspaper, and crime biography\u2014while also employing Acker's now signature maneuvers: shifting genders, appropriation, the incessant emphasis on power and sex. Acker wanted to figure out, she said, how to engage a hegemonic, mainstream culture, which she called \"the jailer,\" and transform its meaning or its relationship to \"us\"\u2014us being the marginalized, the poor, artists. \"I'm all excited by my new book,\" she told Silliman, \"which everyone will hate it's what I've always wanted to do.\" While still far more concerned with ideas, she was also becoming, in her own way, more interested in the usual architecture of fiction: story and plot. While dismissive of mainstream contemporaries such as Joyce Carol Oates, she raved to Silliman about writers like Thomas Pynchon: \"God Pynchon's a good writer! I see how much I have to learn. I'm still so awkward & slow & uncourageous. I do things too slowly. I mean he has such a range!\" She found further inspiration in a more unlikely source\u2014bestselling schlockmeister Harold Robbins. As always, she scorned any distinction between so-called high and low culture, and happily read (and borrowed from) writers and genres\u2014porn and pulp fiction, most obviously\u2014that her more snobby colleagues tended to shun. Robbins knew the power of a good story as well as the power of a good fake biography\u2014he famously concocted his own outlandish rags-to-riches backstory. And, similar to Acker, albeit to much different effect, he stole his epic plots and larger-than-life characters from real life, fictionalizing everyone from Frank Sinatra to pornographer Larry Flynt. As Acker told Silliman, reading Robbins was positively revolutionary for her:\n            Took to reading J. Suzanne[sic] H. Robbins I. Wallace the last week with the idea that I've been reading everything the avant-garde's done and everything by dead writers but I have no idea what non-avant garde stuff's been done in this country in past 25 years\u2026 Robbins turns out to be the main interest and a large one: his use of fact/fiction business, especially not especially actually in everything I've read so far, the conception of writing as its existence based on audience: reaction so the dealing with anticipation, expectation, maneuvering, etc. all this in relation to American politics and existence, use of story narrative as myth (a source of common energy information) that again has politics advertising conceptual basis, and the information! A range that no avant garde person has touched, and a new way my writing opens. Acker lifted four pages from Robbins's 1974 potboiler The Pirate, itself loosely based on the life of flamboyant billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and folded them into The Adult Life. Whether in tribute or merely, as she said, for \"the information,\" the gesture was both innocent and inspired. \"Robbins is really soft core porn,\" she later said, \"so I wanted to see what would happen if you changed contexts and just upped the sexuality of the language. It's a very simplistic example of deconstruction.\" As entirely different as Acker and Robbins's aesthetics and ambitions may have been, the two writers were united, improbably, in their attempts to capture the unstable interplay of the real and the imaginary and the grotesque machinations of the culture. Robbins had figured out how to make himself rich off of such attempts. Acker, meanwhile, was, in her words, \"just some nut who piddles around with these problems to amuse and teach herself.\" In the spring of 1975, Gordon moved back to New York more or less for good, and he and Acker sublet Constance DeJong's apartment while the latter spent the summer in India. Acker had her own room, which she decorated with books, vivid yellow-and-orange Mexican fabrics, and a foam pad draped with a white silk quilt. \"This slum will have to do,\" she told Silliman. She told him too that there were \"about four guys I sleep with now and then.\" One of these relationships was more meaningful than the rest. Through Aline Mare, she had met the writer Rudy Wurlitzer, a friend of Richard Serra's and Philip Glass's. Wurlitzer was a novelist and screenwriter with an appealingly gnomic aura. By that point, he'd already published three acclaimed books, each a distinctive, haunting blend of minimalism and psychedelia, as well as the original screenplays for Monte Hellman's Two-Lane Blacktop, the entirety of which had been printed in Esquire, and Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid. Acker was clearly drawn to his fame\u2014he was another example of someone who had found success on his own terms\u2014but their romance was agonizing from the start. Acker referred to them as \"best friends,\" and she clearly wanted more from the relationship than he did. But every time they slept together, usually at Wurlitzer's run-down apartment on East 23rd, Wurlitzer would \"freak out\" because Acker was still living with Gordon and then he would distance himself from her. \"He's been burned before,\" she told Silliman. In Wurlitzer's recollection, however, they were little more than fuck buddies. Decades later, he said that, while he admired the \"passionate integrity\" of Acker's work, he never thought of them as a couple, nor was there ever the promise that they would become so. The attraction for him was almost purely erotic\u2014\"We both seemed to hit each other's windshields at the same time.\" Their correspondence, however, suggested the relationship was considerably more intense and intimate, at least in the moment. When Wurlitzer later decamped for Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where he was living with Robert Frank and collaborating on his film Keep Busy, he wrote Acker several letters\u2014long, pained, portentous discussions about what their romance meant and didn't mean, his distaste for the New York art and literary worlds, his own spiritual anomie. About to turn forty, Wurlitzer could be as much of a drama queen as Acker. For her part, Acker seemed to crave his literary and intellectual guidance. She would occasionally dismiss her own writing and was for the moment obsessed with Japanese writers like Yukio Mishima and Yasunari Kawabata, told Wurlitzer that she aspired to their elegance: \"simple paragraphs, each paragraph an image. 1, 2, 3. The flow absolutely like a straight line.\" Acker applied for a grant from Creative Artists Public Service (CAPS), administered by the New York State Council on the Arts. If she got the money, she was thinking of using it to head somewhere warm, either Florida or Haiti, and then, the following summer, to Nova Scotia and Wurlitzer. That latter trip would never happen; by then, Wurlitzer was spending more and more time in Paris and Hollywood. In the early eighties, he would give Acker a copy of his novel-in-progress, Slow Fade, and though it wasn't her style\u2014\"he sets Hollywood bland language deals against Tibetan-Indian gorgeous searchings\"\u2014reading it, she said, felt like she was \"touching Rudy's naked body.\" Soon after, though, and to Acker's dismay, Wurlitzer lost all contact with her. \"We disappeared into separate worlds,\" he said. Romantic angst rarely interfered with Acker's writing, however, and she worked throughout, further prodded by the example of Harold Robbins's productivity. \"Even a hack novelist works an eight-hour day,\" she said. All her labor began to pay off. In July, she received her first real press coverage. In the July 4\u201310 edition of the Berkeley Barb, Loren Means published a glowing review of the TVRT edition of The Childlike Life headlined \"Kathy's Genius.\"I The review compared and contrasted Acker's book with Andrei Codrescu's The Life and Times of an Involuntary Genius, concluding, \"So Andrei will probably be a star\u2014his work is fun, and doesn't threaten. And Kathy will probably remain as she is\u2014pissed off and brilliant, and so scary.\" On July 21, Acker and Gordon performed at the Poetry Project, and the Project's newsletter advertised The Adult Life: \"The Adult Life of Toulouse Lautrec is the most recent outgrowth from the overactive cranium of the Black Tarantula, alias Kathy Acker. This adorable little sex & mayhem pamphlet is available for a dollar, change, c/o The Project.\" To Acker's delight and surprise, even the New Yorker took notice of this reading, including her in an August 4th \"Talk of the Town\": \"The Black Tarantula, a young white woman with short brown hair, read excerpts from her new novel to fifty people at St. Mark's In-the-Bouwerie Episcopal Church. There's a murder in the book, which takes place in Montmartre in 1886. The characters include Vincent van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Hercule Poirot, left for dead hours earlier at Publishers Weekly.\" Later that winter, in the December 29, 1975, issue of the Village Voice, Richard Goldstein listed Acker in a roundup of the year's best writers, with an accompanying photo and blurb which read \"she has produced a stream of seminarrative prose, culled from raw data and her own sense of melodrama.\" At the bottom of the same page was none other than Andy Warhol, whose The Philosophy of Andy Warhol had come out earlier that year. At last, she was in the company she had so long craved. I. The paper listed the publisher as Viper's Tongue, which was essentially Leandro Katz's imprint at TVRT (conceived originally in Peru in 1961). After TVRT's demise, he would continue to use the imprint\u2014\"my seal,\" he called it\u2014whenever he published anything of his own. ",
  "18": "AFTER DEJONG RETURNED FROM INDIA that fall, Acker and Gordon found their own place, at 341 East Fifth Street, between First and Second, near the police station. A quintessential East Village railroad apartment, it was dark and cramped, with a kitchen and bathtub in the back, two corridor rooms, and a main bedroom in the front. Acker took the front bedroom, filling it with manuscripts and so many books that a friend joked there were \"about seventy-two thousand.\" Roaches were such a routine nuisance you couldn't open a book or the fridge, which just barely worked, without a couple scurrying out. At one point, when Freilicher was visiting, the ceiling in the main room collapsed, sending plaster and dust everywhere. The East Village itself was a dangerous ruin, prostitution and drug use rampant, the membrane between bohemia and underworld exceedingly thin. Their rent was $150 a month, something they still found tough to make. While Gordon was gigging and trying to put together his own bands and projects, he worked in radio production, cutting tape and other audio work. Acker's paycheck from the Kitchen was still small enough that she was eligible for food stamps, and in a letter to Silliman she enumerated the meager contents of their fridge: \"eight eggs, a bit of butter, a carrot, tea, and half a daikon.\" At some point, Lawrence Weiner\u2014\"one of the nicest artists around,\" as Acker called him\u2014gave her an emergency thirty-five bucks. Just as Acker had, Gordon threw himself into downtown's various cultural scenes. Despite Chatham's initial jealousy toward him, the two became fast friends and collaborators. Gordon also reunited with Jill Kroesen, who was working with Arthur Russell, a pop-art musician and composer who'd been a lover of both Allen Ginsberg and Kevin Killian. Since coming back to New York\u2014in an illustration of just how small and incestuous the scene really was\u2014Kroesen had fallen in love with and married Acker's ex, Lenny Neufeld. The same month that Acker and Gordon appeared at St. Mark's, Kroesen and Neufeld performed there too. With Chatham, Russell, and other like-minded musicians, Gordon began forming ad-hoc ensembles, playing the Kitchen, Artists Space, and other venues, eventually forming the Love of Life Orchestra, a renowned conceptual pop band that included Kroesen, Chatham, Russell, David Van Tieghem, \"Blue\" Gene Tyranny, Laurie Anderson, David Byrne from time to time, and Acker herself. The band's first record, which they released in 1978 on Mimi Johnson's label, Lovely Music, was the wryly titled Star Jaws. As Gordon found his footing in the art-music world, Acker was finishing up Toulouse Lautrec and thinking ahead toward bigger projects. She was still sending the serials to subscribers on her mailing list\u2014it now numbered about five hundred people, she said\u2014but she was weary of scrambling for printers and the money to pay them. \"I want to do a big novel,\" she told an interviewer. \"I've changed.\" She felt she'd arrived at the end of the intellectual puzzles she was exploring in the book. \"The problem of identity had become too complex,\" she wrote a decade later, \"and, at the same time, had resolved itself. I realized that identity is made, the legend of Daedalus is true, and perhaps of Icarus, that when one writes, one doesn't express true or false identity, truth or falsity, one makes identity.\" The identity that Acker was making, or at least asserting, was one that was increasingly aggressive, even cutthroat. Her former complaints about the competitiveness of the art world started to sound hollow, as she began to see other writers, particularly young, female writers exploring similarly innovative terrain, as an existential threat. Even mutually beneficial alliances could be sabotaged, or heedlessly discarded. In January 1976, she and DeJong persuaded the Kitchen to allow them to perform on a double bill later that month. Heretofore, the venue had had no literary programming, welcoming only performance artists, dancers, and musicians to its stage\u2014its official name at the time was the Kitchen Center for Video and Music\u2014but Acker and DeJong argued that they too were performers of a sort. \"It was a big deal,\" DeJong recalled. \"A lot of people would come to the Kitchen.\" Acker decided to stage a candlelit reading, with Laurie Anderson and Jill Kroesen, of a new short story she'd titled \"Florida,\" a loose adaptation of Maxwell Anderson's play Key Largo, which had been turned into the John Huston film of the same name. She'd written it, she said, when a PID flare-up left her in bed for three weeks. \"I had a strong, undeniable urge to read the script for Key Largo,\" she remembered. \"Such a script was not to be found, at least by me in my bed. So I did the next best thing, I wrote this script according to my memory. A memory of holes, like those landscapes I love the most.\" DeJong meanwhile performed sections of Modern Love, accompanied by prerecorded musical elements and another person voicing one of the characters. In the Kitchen's press release, Acker was listed first and DeJong second. But just before the 8:30 event was to start, Acker took DeJong aside and said that they needed to talk about which order they would go on. The thought hadn't occurred to DeJong, but it was clearly something that Acker had given ample consideration to. \"I'll just tell you that you don't want to go second,\" she said to DeJong. \"Because what I'm doing is so amazing, you cannot follow.\" DeJong was shocked. When did her friend transform into her rival? The floor, she remembered, seemed to open up beneath her. Suddenly, she saw the dark side of Acker's drive. \"That was Kathy's first move to winnow me out,\" DeJong said. \"She just had to exclude me from her existence in this kind of totalizing, brutal way.\" Whatever Acker's reasons, it was apparent that she didn't just need attention, she needed all the attention. After that reading, the two women never really spoke again. When they were in the same room, Acker would look the other way. On the road, when people would ask Acker about DeJong, in a what-happened-to-her kind of way, Acker would lie and say that DeJong had given up writing. Even worse, she would tell people that she, Acker, had taught her everything she knew. A couple years later, when the Village Voice was promoting a reading that she and DeJong were to give on behalf of photographer-writer Anne Turyn's Top Stories\u2014a popular series of downtown chapbooks (\"a prose periodical\") by women writers published between 1978 and 1991\u2014Acker refused to participate in an accompanying photograph if DeJong was also going to be included. Even after that, at another event, DeJong, intent on burying the hatchet, approached Acker and tried to talk to her. But Acker was capable of sustaining hostilities for a long time\u2014she turned her back on DeJong again. Decades later, the rejection and animosity still rankled and perplexed DeJong. \"When you maintain a whole constellation of grudges and enmities and make enemies of people,\" DeJong said, \"that's a lot of burden to hold around in your head.\" What compelled such abruptly hard-hearted behavior? Was it borne out of a misplaced sense of self-preservation, a matter of, as she so often put it to Silliman, survival? Eileen Myles, who could be, by their own admission, a relatively driven person, even \"manipulative,\" recognized the possible necessity of Acker's cunning, even as they found it noxious and vaguely preposterous in the relatively genteel poetry world. \"Rock 'n' roll, art, theater people\u2014they're all unabashed ambition, all about winning, and getting it,\" Myles said. \"Kathy had that. She was on a climb. She was such a cunt. But the fact is, she got up every fucking day and wrote. It was her religion. That's why she was here. That's awesome. That's awesome for a woman. It's awesome for a woman to say, I have that, and then deliver.\" Other people, of course, took a more dim view. \"I think she felt intellectually superior to other people,\" Pooh Kaye said. \"And she'd just drop them. They'd become uninteresting.\" Jill Kroesen saw something even more insidious. Even though Acker had ditched Neufeld and obviously had her hands full, sexually speaking, once he and Kroesen married, Acker still made attempts to seduce him again. \"I think she was dangerous,\" Kroesen said. \"It was just take, take, take, take, take. And if you really let her, she just would hurt you.\" But Kroesen came back, again, to Acker's childhood, blaming her \"abandonment\" for what she considered an almost sociopathic cruelty. \"I think that her pain was so severe,\" she said. \"I think she was doing whatever she could to get rid of the pain. She was desperate.\" Acker was so often conflicted about her own writing\u2014entirely convinced of its importance one day, self-deprecating about it the next\u2014that perhaps the only position she could consistently sustain was one of embattlement. It was also maybe the professional analog to a pattern that Freilicher saw play out in her romantic relationships. In the early days of a new romance, she tended to idolize a paramour, catering to their every need, acting, in her words, like a \"geisha.\" Soon, however, she would turn self-protective and selfish. Her work, as always, would again become her first priority; her needs would take absolute precedence. \"She felt like she was kind of deceiving people about who she was,\" Freilicher said, \"and made it impossible when they found out because they wanted her to be the geisha.\" Whatever the case, the break with DeJong was only the first such rift that Acker would have with her literary peers\u2014mostly women, but occasionally men too. As her career unfolded, there would be several other rivalries, grudges, and quarrels, often over the most trivial differences or slights. With other female writers, she was often at first solicitous and supportive, helping them to secure publishers, providing blurbs for their books. But she could retract that support as soon as she felt imperiled. As her own fame grew, it seemed that the only other writers she could tolerate for long were young, emerging, and preferably fawning ones, or those who were more famous or powerful than she. Sometime in the early to mid-nineties, Acker drew up a document, seemingly never published, that she titled \"Ten Out of Many Women Writers.\" The list, which actually included eleven writers, opens with this preface: \"This is a list of writers who are female whose work matters to me. It isn't a list of the women writers whose work matters the most to me, for I don't think nor feel in that way\u2014so absolutely and judgementally. And it's a list of the writers, rather than of works, for it's the writer's work throughout time, a lifetime, the process rather than any individual work that interests me.\" She divided the list into two categories, \"The Older Ones\" and \"Contemporaries (briefly).\" The older ones included (in order) Jane Austen, George Sand, George Eliot, and Gertrude Stein (\"the mother of us all,\" Acker wrote also, alluding to the title of the Virgil Thomson opera for which Stein wrote the libretto). On the contemporaries list: Hannah Arendt, Simone de Beauvoir, Luce Irigaray, Christa Wolf, Marguerite Duras, Maya Deren, and Emily Bront\u00eb (\"for wildness\"). Despite Bront\u00eb's eccentric inclusion, Acker obviously meant contemporaries in a temporal sense. But it was telling that, unless you count the naturalized Arendt, only one of these contemporary writers was American (Deren), and none were, in any real sense, her contemporaries. Literary success, to Acker, was a zero-sum, take-no-prisoners game. "
