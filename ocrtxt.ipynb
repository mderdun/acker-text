      "of discipline, or he had made up his mind that Marchant \n",
      "needed a bit of hazing. Marchant seems to have had some \n",
      "• reason for his point of view, voiced on the dock before \n",
      "sailing. It was the contemporary point of view of the \n",
      "British sailor in those days, who regarded a Yankee ship \n",
      "with an aversion second only to his abhorrence of a Blue­\n",
      "nose, a Nova Scotiaman. No decks were as snowy, no \n",
      "canvas broken out as smartly, no sail carried as long, and, \n",

      "below and turned in, telling Hughes to call him at twelve \n",
      "o'clock. This left Hughes and Curtis of the captain's \n",
      "watch alone on deck. • \n",
      "At midnight, at the change of watch, Hughes went for­\n",
      "ward and called Marchant, who came on deck. Then \n",
      "Hughes went below to call the captain, as he had been ordered to do. Selfridge was asleep, and Hughes wakened \n",
      "him. \n",
      "''It's twelve o'clock, sir.\" \n",
      "'' All right, Hughes. How are we headed?'' \n",
      "'' East, northeast, sir. No more wind than when you \n",
      "turned in.\" The captain stretched himself in his bunk and \n",
      "said nothing more. Hughes went back on deck. Marchant \n",
      "hag relieved Curtis at the \n",
      "wheel. Hughes loitered about the \n",
      "deck for some ten minutes, and then, finding that the • captain did not come up, he called the mate. Jenkins came \n",
      "on deck. \n",
      "'' How have we been \n",
      "going, Hughes?'' he asked. \n",
      "''Wind about the same, sir,\" Hughes told him, ''holding \n",
      "east, nortl1east. '' \n",
      "'' All right, Hughes. You may go below.'' \n",
      "It was now nearly half-past twelve, and Hughes turned \n",
      "in. As he entered the fo'c'sle he could see both Curtis \n",
      "and Murray in their bunks. \n",
      "At about four that morning Murray woke with a start. \n",
      "He had been asleep for some hours. He did not know why \n",
      "he had wakened, but he was frightened. Realizing that the \n",
      "fo'c'sle air was unusually hot and close, he went to the \n",
      "hatch. It was closed. That was strange. He pushed against \n",
      "it, but it did not move. It must be fastened on the outside. \n",
      "Murray felt around the black dark of the fo'c'sle among \n",
      "the bunks and found only Hughes present. Curtis' bunk was empty, but Murray's groping hands found Curtis' hat on his seatnan's chest. That was stranger still. Murray \n",
      "crept back to his own bunk, the fear of death at his throat. \n",
      "Three days later, the American schooner, Sally, out of \n",
      "Newburyport for Labrador, rode at her anchor in the \n",
      "harbor of Louisbourg. \n",
      "A hundred years ago, Louisbourg, on the east coast of \n",
      "Cape Breton Island, was as_well known to most American \n",
      "sailing masters and their mates as any port \n",
      "ort their \n",
      "home coasts. It is \n",
      "the only port on the Atlantic coast of \n",
      "• Canada that is free from ice the year round, and because of \n",
      "this and other natural advantages it has been the favored \n",
      "resort of mariners since the days of Queen Elizabeth. \n",
      "Indeed, so well did New England skippers know the port that they once led a siege against the great fortress that \n",
      "France had built there. They set out in the first American \n",
      "Expeditionary Force to capture Louisbourg, and capture it \n",
      "they did. In the eighty years that had elapsed between \n",
      "that capture and the day the \n",
      "Sally rode at anchor off the \n",
      "town Louisbourg had fallen \n",
      "from its high estate. It was no \n",
      "longer a fortified city. Its ramparts ·had been blow11 into \n",
      "ruins, and \n",
      "the town existed only as an insignificant fishing \n",
      "village. But its harbor was famous still, British territory, \n",
      "as it is today. \n",
      "On that August day, the Sally had put into Louisbourg \n",
      "to fill her water casks. \n",
      "Unlike the rugged and beautiful western slope of Cape \n",
      "Breton Island, the Louisbourg coast is low and flat, fog­\n",
      "wrapped much of the year. But on this day the weather \n",
      "was clear. The old clearings of the French occupation were \n",
      "growing up in young spruce trees, and back of these \n",
      "stretched dense woods. Half a dozen fishermen's houses \n",
      "straggled along the shore, some distance apart. One of \n",
      "these, the Slatery house, was the main source of supplies \n",
      "for vessels in port, and it was to call at Slatery's that Mr. \n",
      "Francis Pike, mate of the Sally, had himself rowed ashore \n",
      "in the late afternoon of August 30th. As he neared the \n",
      "beilch Mr. Pike, looking back \n",
      "over his shoulder at the sea, -noticed a peculiar craft, \n",
      "a small sailboat carrying a ship's \n",
      "• \n",
      "• topgallant sail, just entering the harbor. Four men were in \n",
      "her. Mr. Pike's keen seaman's eyes could even distinguish \n",
      "their faces. \n",
      "''That's a queer-looking craft,'' commented Mr. Pike. \n",
      "About a half hour later, while Pike was still at the \n",
      "Slatery's, two of the four men came up to the house. \n",
      "They were Marchant and Hughes. \n",
      "Mrs. Slatery came forward. Her husband was away from \n",
      "home, but she was equally used to dealing with sailormen. \n",
      "Her brother was mate of a Boston schooner. Jenkins, his \n",
      "name was, Joseph Paine Jenkins. \n",
      "''Good-day, ma'am,'' said Marchant. ''Could you tell \n",
      "me what place this is?'' \n",
      "'' Louisbourg, Cape Breton Island,'' Mrs. Slatery told \n",
      "him. \n",
      "''Louisbourg,'' Marchant repeated. ''Near Sydney, that \n",
      "• \n",
      "is.\" He turned to Pike. '' How far would it be to Sydney, \n",
      "• ?'' sir. \n",
      "'' Couldn't tell you that,'' Pike answered. ''My first \n",
      "trip in these waters.\" \n",
      "'' Perhaps you'd know the course for Halifax?'' Mar­\n",
      "chant went on. \n",
      "'' West by south,'' Pike told him. He looked curiously at. \n",
      "Marchant and at the weedy, frightened-looking seaman behind him. \n",
      "'' Guess they haven't slept \n",
      "for a week,'' l1e \n",
      "thought. Aloud he said, '' Where are you from?'' \n",
      "Marchant told him. -\n",
      "'' He replied,\" Pike \n",
      "related afterwards, '' that he had \n",
      "been cast away in the brig Fame, Francis Avery, captain \n",
      "• \n",
      "' \n",
      "• • and owner, from Philadelphia, bound to Labrador for fish. \n",
      "I asked how large a crew he had. He said that there were \n",
      "eight men, that the captain, mate, and two of the crew \n",
      "took the other boat and were lost sight of in the fog, and \n",
      "that he feated they were lost.\" \n",
      "'' Do you happen to know,\" Marchant went on, '' of any \n",
      "vessel bound for Halifax?'' \n",
      "Apparently there was one in the harbor, and Pike \n",
      "pointed her out. Marchant asked Mrs. Slatery if she could \n",
      "sell them some milk. -''Yes, indeed,\" she said, '' bring a bucket up with you. \n",
      "The girl is just milking.\" Poor fellows, she thought-i·t \n",
      "might have been her brother's ship Fairy, instead of the \n",
      "brig Fame. \n",
      "Marchant and Hughes went off, Hughes having hung \n",
      "mute in \n",
      "the background throughout the interview, and \n",
      "fifteen minutes later -a third member of the castaways \n",
      "appeared, a bucket in his hand. Pike later recognized him \n",
      "as Curtis. \n",
      "To make conversation while Mrs. Slatery fetched the \n",
      "milk, Pike asked the newcomer if he too was one of the \n",
      "shipwrecked crew. Curtis said that he was. He repeated \n",
      "much the same story as had Marchant, but spun of a richer \n",
      "fa~ric and embellished with descriptions \n",
      "more circumstan­\n",
      "tially ornate. \n",
      "''I'm a Danvers man myself,'' he said. ''The captain \n",
      "belonged to Marblehead. Adams, his name was. He was a \n",
      "da,nned rascal too, and as \n",
      "green as a cabbage leaf.\" \n",
      "(Curtis had evidently not forgotten the bucket of sea ,-\n",
      "water.) ''We've been in that little boat for three days and a \n",
      "half. I'm 'most beat out.\" \n",
      "He told his tale convincingly·-Pike did not then notice \n",
      "the change in the captain's name·-and besides, he was an \n",
      "American. Pike was rather \n",
      "taken with him. \n",
      "So when Pike went on board his vessel a little later, he \n",
      "spoke to the captain about the strange boat in the harbor \n",
      "and the plight of her crew. \n",
      "''There's four of 'em,\" he said; ''I only saw twoi-one a \n",
      "limey, the other a Yank.\" \n",
      "'' I'll go ashore and talk to them in the morning,\" Cap• \n",
      "tain Hook (shades of \n",
      "Peter Pan!) replied. '' If there are \n",
      "any more Americans among them, I'll give them a passage \n",
      "home.\" Meantime, the longboat and her four occupants \n",
      "put off from shore, anchored, and spent the night. \n",
      "Not long after sunrise the next morning, Captain \n",
      "Hook went ashore to see what he could do for his distressed \n",
      "fellow countrymen. The four castaways, Marchant and \n",
      "Curtis, Hughes and Murray, were on the beach. Curtis, \n",
      "acting as spokesman this \n",
      "time, told their story once more; \n",
      "the brig Fame, the leak, abandonment at sea, the loss of \n",
      "the other \n",
      "boat. \n",
      "'' How many of you are Americans?'' asked Captain \n",
      "Hook briskly. Curtis and Murray stepped forward, Curtis \n",
      "saying, ''I am, sir, and the cook here. Can you give us a \n",
      "passage?'' \n",
      "''By all means,\" answered Hook. ''Take your gear \n",
      "aboard the Sally. Tell Mr. Pike I sent you. Be lively, for \n",
      "I'll sail with the first fair wind.\" \n",
      "• \n",

      "only too glad to be rid of each other, Marchant and \n",
      "Hughes to negotiate a passage to Halifax with the master \n",
      "of the British ship, and Curtis and Murray to go aboard \n",
      "the Sally. An hour or so later, when Captain Hook went \n",
      "back on board his ship for breakfast, Mr. Pike had a \n",
      "strange tale to tell. \n",
      "Curtis and Murray had come aboard the Sally bringing \n",
      "with them a sea chest, a bag, and two hats. Curtis ex­\n",
      "plained to the mate that the captain had given them leave \n",
      "to come and put their things on board, whereupon Mr. \n",
      "Pike asked where \n",
      "they would have the chest stowed, aft or \n",
      "forward. Curtis looked irresolutely about and then said \n",
      "vaguely: \n",
      "'' I guess it might stand where it is. I'm going on shore for \n",
      "a few minutes. I'll be right back and will look after it \n",
      "then.\" . \n",
      "Pike thought this curious behavior, as indeed it was, for \n",
      "a shipwrecked mariner, but he said nothing, only moving \n",
      "away and watching the pair from a little distance. He saw \n",
      "Curtis unlock the chest, take out some expensive-looking \n",
      "clothes, put these in the bag, and, taking the bag with \n",
      "him, return to the shore with Murray. \n",
      "What had incited Curtis to such an idiotic procedure, \n",
      "throwing away the game when he held it safe in his hand? \n",
      "No one will ever know. It may be that in that instant \n",
      "when Mr. Pike asked his innocent question as to the stow­\n",
      "age of the chest, Curtis \n",
      "had realized that it held com­\n",
      "promising loot from the Fairy, the clothes of the captain \n",
      "• or the mate, perhaps, and that he simply obeyed the blind \n",
      "instinct of fear and guilt that bade him be rid of them at \n",
      "any cost. In any event, his move was fatal. Captain Hook \n",
      "agreed with his mate that the proceeding was very odd, to \n",
      "say the least, and that it had best be looked into at once. \n",
      "He determined to go back on shore and cross-examine the \n",
      "mysterious four. \n",
      "''There may have been some difficulty aboard their \n",
      "vessel,'' he speculated aloud. ''I guess I'll inquire into \n",
      "their story again. If I find it suspicious, I'll take them in \n",
      "charge. If not·-wl1y, let them go.'' \n",
      "One can \n",
      "only hope that Captain Hook waited long \n",
      "enough to have his breakfast, for he was destined to have \n",
      "an exhausting day. \n",
      "With Mate Pike and three men, Captain Hook went \n",
      "ashore, landing, presumably to avoid arousing suspicion \n",
      "of pursuit, about a half mile up the beach from the Slatery \n",
      "house, where Curtis had been seen to go. \n",
      "They were scarcely ashore when, at a distance of several \n",
      "hundred yards, they saw Murray running towards them. \n",
      "He was out of breath when he reached them, and when he \n",
      "• \n",
      "was able to speak at all he stuttered so painfully that he \n",
      "• could hardly make himself \n",
      "understood. Murray had been \n",
      "through a lot in the past four days, and now that he had \n",
      "given way to his terror he was in the grip of sheer panic. \n",
      "At last he made Captain Hook understand. \n",
      "''You m-must go right away, and t-t-take those two -fellows!'' he gasped, sobbing with fright. '' Curtis and \n",
      "Marchant--'they're murderers·-·they killed the captain \n",
      "• \n",
      "• • and the m-mate! Get Marchant first·-he's the worst!'' \n",
      "And then, quieting a little, he was able to tell Captain \n",
      "Hook that Marchant had gone up to the Old City, the site \n",
      "of the old fortress of Louisbourg, which was three miles \n",
      "away. Captain Hook was a man of action. \n",
      "'' I'll have those two rascals if it costs me my life!'' he \n",
      "snapped. Sending Murray on board the Sally, Hook took \n",
      "his men and started for the Old City by boat, in order to \n",
      "cut off Marchant, who had gone by land. But as the boat \n",
      "passed by the Slatery house, which Curtis had been \n",
      "seen to enter, Curtis himself came-out of the door \n",
      "and \n",
      "disappeared round the corner of the building. \n",
      "'' Put ashore, men!'' roared Hook. ''That son-of-a­\n",
      "bitch is going to make off!'' \n",
      "As the keel grounded, the captain jumped for the beach, \n",
      "and at that moment John Hughes also appeared. He had \n",
      "caught the general p;inic. \n",
      "''I'm clear!'' he chattered. ''I'm clear!'' \n",
      "'' So I hear,'' Hook told him, '' but you get into my \n",
      "boat just the same!'' \n",
      "And then, in the captain's own words, ''I then ran as fast \n",
      "as I could after Curtis. He did not run at first, but walked. I now began to think they had agreed to meet each other \n",
      "on the other side of the forest, and after hunting around \n",
      "for half an hour I told my men to go up to the Old City in \n",
      "the boat, and I would go up by land.\" \n",
      "The two least dangerous of the four were taken, and one \n",
      "notes, parenthetically, that the intrepid Hook starts off in \n",
      "• pursuit of two desperate men over an uninhabited stretch of wooded country, without arms of any kind. Times have \n",
      "changed. \n",
      "Although the captain started off alone, he took the \n",
      "precaution of picking up three natives as he went along. \n",
      "It was haymaking time, and the men who were not fishing \n",
      "were in the fields. As the little force crossed a field they \n",
      "almost fell over Marchant ''lying on a stack of hay.'' \n",
      "There had been little \n",
      "enough sleep in the Fairy's longboat, \n",
      "the haystack was inviting, and Marchant was exhausted. \n",
      "It was an inglorious finish. The chief mutineer admitted \n",
      "his guilt without more ado. \n",
      "Hughes and Marchant were now taken back, three \n",
      "miles, to the Sally, and since \n",
      "Hook was '' destitute of \n",
      "authority'' in British territory, one of the residents posted \n",
      "off to Sydney for a magistrate, while the search for Curtis \n",
      "went \n",

      "Captain Hook was joined by eight or ten inhabitants, \n",
      "armed with muskets, and the hunt continued until night­\n",

      "though by threat of an armed invasion. A company of \n",
      "soldiers sprang from somewhere (presumably Louisbourg \n",

      "have come from Sydney so speedily). This force guarded the three men already in custody, and sentineled the \n",
      "shore line, '' fearing,\" according to Captain Hook, '' that \n",

      "In the meantime, Marchant had been questioned by the \n",

      "Curtis, Hughes, and the captain; \n",
      "and a spyglass, sextant, and compass; also some provisions and liquors. All things \n",
      "being ready, they told me to go on board the boat and pulled the plugs out of the schooner. Curtis now said she would not sink fast enough, and he took the ax and cut a \n",
      "number of holes in her side. Then she began to fill fast, \n",
      "and we left her. The last time I saw her she was nearly \n",
      "hull down. I could not say exactly how many miles off it was; perhaps three or four. As we steered towards the \n",

      "On shore, Marchant and Curtis entirely lost their heads. \n",
      "They were in continual fear of discovery, in constant terror \n",
      "that Hughes or Murray would give them away. They kept the two lads separated, never left them alone, and re­minded them over and again that if they blabbed all of \n",

      "and Curtis were tried, one for the murder of the captain, \n",
      "and the other for that of the mate. Hughes and Murray \n",
      "were accepted as witnesses for the state. When they came \n",

      "something in Lino's claims, and \n",
      "was unwilling to brand the man openly as an impostor \n",

      "He even took little Lucretia with him, but, evidently \n",

      "they are stated briefly in chronological order. \n",
      "On the 18th, Lino wrote from Philadelphia that he was \n",
      "the guest of Colonel Cuesta, that he had there received a \n",
      "letter saying that his friend who owed him the money was \n",
      "dead, and that he was going on to Baltimore. The letter ended, '' I Remain your invariable and constant faithful \n",

      "more, saying that his dead friend had left him $45,000. .... --------\n",
      "All was well! But under the same cover he wrote to say \n",
      "that ''the law would not allow him to take possession of \n",

      "very touching. This letter had been put into English for \n",
      "Lino by a professional translator who added a postscript \n",

      "matters. Here, for the first time, she learned the truth. \n",
      "The consul assured her that Lino was an impostor, and \n",
      "that he had not seen him for some time. \n",
      "Lino, knowing nothing of this episode, continued to \n",

      "one of any real importance in the entire cor­\n",

      "were, at last, fully opened, and whose very real pain was \n",
      "far too great to permit her to write other than sincerely. \n",
      "In this letter Lucretia reproaches him and pleads with \n",
      "him in turn. She reviews her discovery of his deception and \n",
      "treachery and implores him to return her some part of \n",

      "you or me to be happy this side of the grave.\" It needs no \n",
      "special pleading to recognize that this does imply guilty knowledge, but it seems equally clear \n",

      "was to take him to the foot of the gallows. \n",
      "It was nearly a month later, between August 20th and \n",
      "25th, that the High Constable of Philadelphia, Willis H. \n",
      "Blayney, had a co1mnunication from a gentleman in \n",
      "Washington charging that he had been recently swindled \n",
      "by Lino and enclosing Lucretia's letter. Blayney took the \n",
      "problem to the Acting Recorder of Philadelphia, Joseph M'Ilvaine, and these two, together with a Mr. Reeside, set out for Andalusia to look into matters. The hunt was up. \n",
      "From his own testimony it seems certain that, before \n",
      "interviewing Lucretia, M'Ilvaine had taken the precaution \n",
      "of picking up what neighborhood gossip he could gather. \n",
      "As usual, there was plenty. The day was \n",
      "Stinday, but not \n",
      "everyone was in \n",
      "church; certainly not Mr. Boutcher, the \n",
      "death of whose ducks still weighed heavily upon him. So \n",
      "that, not only was M'Ilvaine ready to ask questions, but \n",
      "armed doubly with Lucretia's letter and the current \n",
      "suspicions of the countryside, he knew pretty well what \n",
      "questions to ask . \n",
      "In the small parlor, Lucretia faced her questioner with \n",
      "unconcealed apprehension. What now? She had not long \n",
      "to wait. M'Ilvaine told her of the complaint from Wash­\n",
      "ington1-but not that he had her letter-that he knew Lino \n",
      "was an impostor, and aske..d whether she ''had suffered \n",
      "from \n",
      "his impositions.\" Lucretia's lips tightened as she said \n",
      "No. M'Ilvaine then quoted her owr1 letter to her, and she \n",
      "• • • \n",
      "• ' was forced to admit what they both already knew. The \n",
      "recorder asked if she knew where Lino was, and again \n",
      "Lucretia said No,-only that he had gone ''North.\" Then \n",
      "came out the amazing fact that she had seen and talked \n",
      "with him only a day or two before. The man had had the \n",
      "incredible audacity to stop and see her on his way from \n",
      "Washington; and not only to see her but even to renew, to \n",
      "some extent, his old spell. Indeed, Lino's influence on \n",
      "Lucretia seems to have \n",
      "been little short of hypnotic. After \n",
      "some circumlocution, M'llvaine suggested that he had \n",
      "''a very strong impression that Mr.-Chapman had died by \n",
      "poison, and that Lino had administered it to him.\" At this, \n",
      "Lucretia grew lividly pale, her dry tongue licked her dryer \n",
      "lips, and she fought for breath. As soon as she could speak, \n",
      "she combated the idea; told of William's affection for \n",
      "Lino, and of Lino's \n",
      "care for William during his last illness. \n",
      "The recorder was not impressed. M'Ilvaine queried her \n",
      "more closely about the circumstances of William's death, \n",
      "and she answered quite frankly and with no indication of \n",
      "guilt. She said that she had been surprised that Lino \n",
      "had stayed so long in Washington, but that he had ex­\n",
      "plained that he had been to New Orleans and back; had \n",
      "gone all the way on the railroad, and had traveled night \n",
      "and day at thirty miles an hour. The recorder pointed \n",
      "out that there was no railroad to New Orleans, and Lu­\n",
      "cretia bit her lip and shrank back. M'Ilvaine finally left, \n",
      "feeling that there was an unpleasant mystery somewhere, \n",
      "and that the first thing to do was to arrest Lino. In this he \n",
      "had less trouble than might have been expected. - ---- -- --\n",
      "It must be reiterated \n",
      "that M'Ilvaine did not know, as \n",
      "very few people knew, that Lucretia and Lino had been \n",
      "married. Even the interested neighbors did not know. \n",
      "Even Lucretia's family and relations-she was a daughter \n",
      "of Colonel Zenas Winslow of Brewster, Barnstable County, \n",
      "Cape Cod-knew only of William's sudden death and of \n",
      "the presence of the rich and interesting young stranger. \n",
      "They knew \n",
      "nothing of the marriage. \n",
      "From ''info11nation received ''-just what information \n",
      "or from whom received was never brought out-M'Ilvaine \n",
      "concluded that Lino was either in Boston or on the Cape, \n",
      "and High Constable Blayney who, in spite of his title, appears to have been a very ordinary policeman, was \n",
      "dis-­\n",
      "patched to arrest him. \n",
      "Ordin·ary or not, Blayney '' got his \n",
      "man'' in the approved fashion, and proceeded at once to \n",
      "escort him back to Philadelphia on the boat. Lino's little \n",
      "fling was over. \n",
      "Before Lino fell \n",
      "into the outstretched arms of the law, \n",
      "however, he managed to create a small tempest of his own on the Cape, after his inimitable fashion and his own \n",
      "singular concept of ethics. \n",
      "In the brief interview he had with Lucretia on his way \n",
      "''North,\" by which we are to understand Cape Cod, Lino \n",
      "got from her-further amazement is futile-letters of in­\n",
      "troduction, not only to her own family, but also to wealthy \n",
      "and influential friends. With these Lino, always a quick \n",
      "worker, proceeded to cash \n",
      "in: He cashed a draft \n",
      "on Lu­\n",
      "cretia for $I ,ooo and then proposed marriage to her niece. \n",
      "Let it not be said that New England is matter of fact and • • immune from romance! The lady, dazzled as her aunt had \n",
      "been before her, accepted the impetuous lover and con­\n",
      "sented to join him in Boston. Only the fact that Lino was \n",
      "arrested twenty-four hours before the marriage was to have \n",
      "taken place saved the Puritan maiden from the toils of \n",
      "the seducer. \n",
      "On the trip back on the boat with High Constable Blay-\n",
      "ney, Lino was taken with one of his'' spells,\" but this time \n",
      "it was a spell of sheer terror. Lino knew what awaited him. \n",
      "In Philadelphia he was clapped promptly into jail and \n",
      "charged with being a swindler. Murder was still unproven. This was during the first week in September, 1831. \n",
      "Lino did not struggle. He seems to have felt that the \n",
      "game was up. Lucretia, however, fought with a panic born \n",
      "of desperation to free herself from the net that, day by \n",
      "day, was closing around her. \n",
      "On September \n",
      "~oth, she called twice upon \n",
      "Recorder \n",
      "M'Ilvaine, accompanied by her counsel, J. H. Campbell, \n",
      "repeating her story over and over again, much as it has \n",
      "been set down here. The recorder, like many who were to \n",
      "follow him, did his best to believe her account, finding \n",
      "himself baffled by the woman's immeasurable \n",
      "folly. Was it \n",
      "possible that anyone could have been such a fool? To this \n",
      "very day, the \n",
      "question remains unanswered. \n",
      "A few days after this talk with Mr. M'Ilvaine, the \n",
      "National Gazette of Philadelphia copied a story from a New \n",
      "York paper linking Lucretia openly with the suspicion of \n",
      "her husband's death. \n",
      "And on the 21st day of September, William Chapman's body was exhu111ed from its grave in All Saints churchyard. \n",
      "It was singularly well preserved. The face was still black, \n",
      "as it had been the night the man had died, the night that \n",
      "Lino had shaved him. \n",
      "Later, the defense was to call the rector of All Saints to \n",
      "testify that the grave had been dug more deeply than \n",
      "usual, and that the quality of the soil might account for \n",
      "the remarkable \n",
      "preservation of the body. It was useless. \n",
      "Even at that time,· one hundred years ago, when the tests \n",
      "for arsenic were far less accurate than they are today, it \n",
      "was a knowtt fact that the presence of arsenic in a body \n",
      "would arrest decay. And when the post-mortem examina­\n",
      "tion was made enough arsenic was still found in William's \n",
      "body to have killed a dozen men. He had been saturated , \n",
      "with the poison. \n",
      "After that, there was no further delay. Lucretia was \n",
      "arrested and lodged in the jail at Erie, charged with \n",
      "murder. The charge against Lino was also changed to the \n",
      "capital offense. \n",
      "From her cell in Erie, Lucretia continued her fight for \n",
      "life. She wrote long appeals to Colonel Cuesta, the cautious \n",
      "consul from Mexico, and it is impossible to read her letters \n",
      "written during this period, as it is impossible to read the \n",
      "earlier ones written to Lino, without being forced to \n",
      "believe that this woman had been a monumental fool but \n",
      "that she was not a murderess. Still, though she called on \n",
      "the world in general and her erstwhile neighbors in par­\n",
      "ticular to vindicate her, both-the world and the \n",
      "neighbors \n",
      "took the entirely practical view that while, indeed, she • \n",
      "• I might be innocent, she had certainly done everything \n",
      "possible to make herself appear guilty. And yet, she did not \n",
      "lack for loyal friends. \n",
      "The two prisoners were held to await the action of the \n",
      "Grand Jury, and their formal indictment took place on \n",
      "December 12th, almost exactly seven months from that \n",
      "warm evening in May when Lino had trudged up to the \n",
      "Chapman house in Andalusia, asking for shelter. \n",
      "On February 14, 1832-and how Fate must have laughed \n",
      "when she chose Valentine's Day I the accused were placed \n",

      "at the Quarter Sessions in -Doylestown. \n",
      "At the very outset, Lucretia's counsel won a vitally \n",
      "important point, in that it was ruled that the two prisoners \n",
      "should have separate trials. Accordingly, Lino was taken \n",
      "back to jail, and Lucretia stood at the bar alone. The \n",
      "separation of Lucretia's cause from that of a man who was \n",
      "now a proven blackguard gave her a good fighting chance . \n",

      "the case. \n",
      "From all the welter of words, a few material points stand \n",
      "out clearly. \n",
      "William Chapman had been poisoned with arsenic. \n",
      "There could be no question as to that. It remained to be \n",
      "discovered who had administered the poison, at what time, and in what way. Means, motive, and opportunity \n",
      "could be proven, directly or \n",
      "by implication, against both \n",
      "Lino and Lucretia. .. ·-__ ,.,._ ... ·---...... _ ------\n",
      "Lino had bought the arsenic, and, considering his re­\n",
      "lationship with Lucretia, it was at least a fair assumption \n",
      "that she was aware of the purchase. Lucretia had an obvi­\n",
      "ous motive for doing away with her husband in her wish to \n",
      "marry Lino and his gold mines. Lino had an equally \n",
      "obvious motive in his desire to marry William's widow \n",
      "and possess himself of her inheritance. The question of \n",
      "'' • '' h h opportunity, owever, presents \n",
      "a muc more com-\n",
      "plicated problem. \n",
      "All during William Chapman's last illness the house had \n",
      "been full of people, servants, neighbors, and children. \n",
      "Almost anyone could have had access to whatever food was served. The prosecution chose largely to disregard William's initial attack and concentrated their efforts \n",
      "on the Monday afternoon and evening of the week that \n",
      "William died; that Monday on which he had suddenly \n",
      "become worse, after having eaten the chicken and drunk \n",
      "a little of the broth, the remains of which had so fatal an \n",
      "effect on Mr. Boutcher's ducklings. \n",
      "On the one hand, it was Lucretia herself who had pre­\n",
      "pared both the broth and the chicken. On the other, so far \n",
      "as the broth was concerned, Lucretia had left it, before \n",
      "·her small daughter took it \n",
      "up to her father's room, on a \n",
      "table that was within easy reach of anyone and everyone. \n",
      "If one of the children had tasted the broth, as might easily \n",
      "have happened, and if the broth had been poisoned, that \n",
      "child would have died. Would any mother have taken \n",
      "such \n",
      "a chance? What little that William had not eaten of the \n",
      "chicken had been thrown out of the kitchen door with the • remains of the broth. The ducklings ate the refuse and \n",
      "died. Was it, then, the chicken alone that was poisoned? \n",

      "of their time and for every detail of their movements about \n",
      "the house as would have been so simple for them to do in \n",
      "most detective stories-was out of the question. There \n",

      "neatly pillared front and between that and the street \n",
      "there was a small expanse of grass and shrubs. Taller build­\n",

      "there lived in the city of Quebec, Canada, a Mr. Robert Wood, a man who had both social position and the money \n",

      "obligation to the community, to the daughters, and to \n",
      "himself, and that is to marry them off just as well and as \n",
      "soon as he can. \n",
      "Whether because of his money or because of the natural \n",
      "attractions of the girls, Mr. Wood managed to do very well for himself-·and for them. The oldest, Georgianna, mar­ried the eldest son of Sir William Clayton and went to live \n",

      "the Royal Artillery, a Dr. McIntosh, and disappeared into \n",

      "at Troy, where her sisters had been before her. Up to that \n",
      "time she was probably as spoiled as any one of five chil-\n",

      "rich and respectable family could be. • \n",
      "Which is to say that the indulgence of her parents stopped \n",
      "short only at the point at which they themselves might be \n",
      "inconvenienced. \n",
      "Charlotte stayed for nearly two years at the seminary \n",
      "in Troy, and during that time she seems to have done little • ---- ------ -·------------\n",
      "to excite remark. She gave a party for a doll, which seems a \n",
      "little odd today considering that she was over six.teen. \n",
      "She was saved from drowning, but the only wonder is that, \n",
      "wearing the bathing suits they did, more '' females'' of the \n",
      "period did \n",
      "not drow11. And she responded with sufficient \n",
      "enthusiasm to a religious '' revival'' in Ferry Street to make her remembered locally. But these are trivial. One thing, \n",
      "and that of real importance, she did do. She fell in love. \n",
      "And she was loved in return. \n",
      "The gentleman who painstakinglycompiled the original \n",
      "account of this curious history, \n",
      "Mr.. D. Wilson, for all his \n",
      "quaint and mid-Victorian turns of phrase, has set down the record so clearly that it is well worth giving in his own \n",
      "words. Says he: \n",
      "'' Among the acquaintances she had formed during her \n",
      "residence at the seminary was a young gentleman of the \n",
      "city, who, from the hour of their introduction, possessed her favorable regard. He was a young man of fine personal bearing and appearance, amiable in his deportment, frank \n",
      "and intelligent. A mutual attachment sprang up between \n",
      "them, and with her temperament and mental organiza­tion, it will be readily conceived, the full torrent of her \n",
      "affections was permitted to How without restraint toward \n",
      "the object of her idolatry. \n",
      "'' Doubts have been \n",
      "expressed, after an examination of \n",
      "her phrenological developments, whether, under any cir­cumstances, she could \n",
      "have held to the strict \n",
      "decor111ns of \n",

      "only love had been suffered to result in the consummation -• • • -- • - • -._ -•- -• r -• • -\n",
      "of marriage, her education, the innate pride and dignity \n",
      "of her character, and her connection with one to whom she \n",
      "was so ardently attached, would have proved sufficient to have restrained her within the bounds of virtue; at least, we are confident she would have avoided the disastrous \n",
      "destiny which has overtaken her.\" \n",
      "In 1855, when D. Wilson made his report, it was \n",

      "and to take \n",
      "up the position in England to which his birth \n",
      "and recently acquired status as a married man entitled \n",
      "him, there was doubtless a hope in Elliot's mind that a \n",
      "new life, new scenes, and new distractions would gradually \n",
      "obliterate Charlotte's memory of her old lover and her \n",
      "shattered romance. The hope was as arniable as it was \n",

      "a day or two at Troy. Or it may have been \n",
      "Charlotte's insistence or Elliot's idea of giving pleasure to \n",
      "his bride. Whatever it was, it was fatal, for from the \n",
      "beginning to the end of her career the city of Troy was \n",
      "destined to be as baleful an influence in Charlotte Wood's \n",
      "life as the plain of Philippi was in that of Brutus. On this \n",

      "apparently aimlessly. There may, however, have been \n",

      "searching for someone? Did she find him, and was her \n",
      "interview the breaking point? No one knows. She certainly \n",
      "found no relief in her masquerade, for these perambula­\n",
      "tions were succeeded by hysterical outbursts in which she \n",
      "raved over her lost hopes and reproached her husband \n",

      "Or was he a man of her husband's? She thought that she \n",

      "But if the neighbors did not talk before this happened, \n",

      "passed and 1852 merged into 1853, Henrietta's dementia • \n",
      "grew in scope and \n",
      "in intensity. The history of the Albany \n",
      "servant girl was repeated over and over again, except \n",
      "that instead of servant girls Henrietta now selected well \n",
      "know11 citizens and respectable householders. \n",
      "Early in 1853, Henrietta's sanity made a final effort to \n",
      "reestablish itself. \n",
      "Henrietta Robinson suddenly resolved to quit the life \n",
      "she had been leading, to go back to England, and to throw \n",
      "herself on her husband's mercy. That she did not do so \n",
      "probably only spared her another disappointment . \n",
      "Making her plans in secret, Henrietta fled to Boston and \n",
      "put up at the Revere House, intending to take the first \n",

      "lover, whoever he was, missed her, and after inquiring \n",
      "at the docks and railroad station traced her without very \n",
      "much difficulty. He followed; and after a long interview \n",

      "white cottage on the \n",

      "lost its throw. \n",
      "From this time on, Henrietta lived in a world of shad­\n",
      "ows. She shattered herself against the wall of delusion that \n",
      "enclosed her. There was no escape. \n",
      "Henrietta gave up her solitude and walked the streets \n",
      "of Troy, sometimes leaning on the arm of her gray-haired \n",
      "manservant and sometimes alone. She stopped casual \n",
      "passers-by to tell them how her neighbors were conspiring \n",
      "against her. She armed herself wit~ pistols and openly \n",
      "threatened the \n",
      "murder of those who she insisted were \n",
      "bent on her ruin. Her neighbors, according to her, were a \n",
      "band of burglars who were going to pillage her house. She \n",
      "insisted that a man who lived near her had stopped navi­\n",
      "gation in the Hudson and demanded that the authorities \n",
      "do something about it. Armed with her pistol, she roamed the city at night, and one very early morning went on her \n",
      "wanderings wearing only her nightdress. She boasted of a \n",
      "magic cork which she could hold between her teeth and \n",
      "which would float her safely across the Hudson. \n",
      "These mental lapses, while they grew in frequency and \n",
      "intensity, were succeeded by periods during which \n",
      "Henrietta seemed to be perfectly rational. Most of the time she appeared to be quiet, well bred, and well behaved, \n",
      "apparently quite normal. And then, a word or a look \n",
      "would throw her off balance, and she would become rav­\n",
      "ingly insane. \n",

      "by this time, Henrietta was as mad as the proverbial \n",
      "Hatter. On one point, however, she was perfectly constant: \n",
      "Never by word or sign did she ever betray her true name \n",
      "and history. '' \n",
      "Henrietta Robinson'' was to mask her until \n",
      "the end. \n",
      "Sometime between the 10th and the 15th of May, 1853, \n",
      "Mrs. Robinson went into the drug store kept by William \n",
      "H. Ostrom, on the corner of River and Federal streets, \n",
      "and asked for some arsenic to kill rats. Mr. Ostrom sold \n",
      "her two ounces. Henrietta took the arsenic home and hid \n",
      "it under the carpet. \n",
      "Almost opposite the white cottage, on the corner of \n",
      "Rensselaer and River streets, there was a small grocery \n",
      "store kept by an Irishman named Timothy Lanagan. \n",
      "Lanagan' s house consisted of only two rooms, in one of \n",
      "which was the store and in the other of which lived Lana­\n",
      "gan, his wife, and four children. That was the measure of \n",
      "• \n",
      "the business. \n",
      "Lanagan helped out the grocery trade by selling liquor \n",
      "on the side, and every now and again he would give a \n",
      "dance in the grocery, which was well attended by what­\n",
      "ever Irish could squeeze their way in. It was a typical \n",
      "Irish crossroads enterprise, transplanted to Troy. \n",
      "Henrietta bought her groceries from Lanagan, and dur­\n",
      "ing the spring of '53, he noticed that her orders for beer \n",
      "and brandy increased measurably. \n",
      "It was at this time too that Catherine Lubee, Lanagan's \n",
      "sister-in-law, a girl of twenty-five who had been in domes-92 \n",
      "tic service in Albany, but who was now out of a job, came \n",
      "to make the seventh occupant of the room adjoining \n",
      "the grocery store. She seemed a simple, rather attractive, \n",
      "and wholly inoffensive girl. \n",
      "About the middle of May, Lanagan gave one of his \n",
      "dances in the grocery, and this time Henrietta Robinson \n",
      "was one of the guests. It was a long step dow11, even for \n",
      "Henrietta. For Charlotte Wood it was about the final \n",
      "• \n",
      "circle in hell. During the evening Henrietta complained \n",
      "that one of the men there had insulted her. Perhaps he \n",
      "had, but probably it was only a part of her general de­\n",
      "lusion. In any event, she made such a to-do over the alleged \n",
      "insult that the Lanagans asked her to leave. And, after dis­\n",
      "tributing a few insults on her own account, she did so. \n",
      "The entire incident is unimportant, except for the fact \n",
      "that it was to be cited later as a reason for Henrietta's \n",
      "animus against the Lanagan household. \n",
      "Early on the morning of May 25th, Henrietta crossed \n",
      "the street to Lanagans' and bought a quart of beer. \n",
      "About two hours later, she sent her gray-headed gardener \n",
      "over to borrow two dollars of Lanagan, a sum for which she \n",
      "had no possible need. No sooner had the gardener reached \n",
      "the store, however, than Henrietta was at his heels, de­\n",
      "manding to know why he was so long about it. The \n",
      "Lanagans didn't want to lend the two dollars and so said \n",
      "simply that they didn't have it. Henrietta went home, but \n",
      "at eleven o'clock she was back again, this time with a \n",
      "wild tale, that she had told many times before, that her \n",
      "husband had been in a railway accident. She went through \n",
      "• the store into the back room, where there were several \n",
      "loungers, and totally forgetting the story of her injured \n",
      "husband became involved in an argument that led finally \n",
      "to her being conducted to the door. \n",
      "In 1849 Charlotte Wood was a person of consideration in \n",
      "London society. Four years later, in 1853, she was being \n",
      "put out of the back room of a wayside saloon. The descent into hell had not been easy, but it had been sure. \n",
      "At one o'clock. Henrietta was \n",
      "back at the Lanagans' \n",
      "again. This \n",
      "time she found the family in the back room \n",
      "sitting down to their midday \n",
      "meal. There was an egg on \n",
      "the table, and Henrietta pointed to it, saying: \n",
      "''Whose egg is that?'' \n",
      "''Yours, if you want it,'' replied Lanagan, and then, \n",
      "having finished his own meal, got up and went out into the \n",
      "store, leaving Henrietta, Mrs. Lanagan, and Catherine at \n",
      "the table. The Lanagan children were, evidently, not there. \n",
      "They had probably been fed earlier and sent out of doors. \n",
      "Henrietta sat down at the table, and Mrs. Lanagan \n",
      "peeled a potato for her, which she ate with her egg. This simple repast being disposed of, Henrietta invit'ed Mrs. \n",
      ". Lanagan and Catherine to \n",
      "join her in a glass of beer. They \n",
      "both refused. Paying no attention to this, Henrietta \n",
      "asked for some sugar, and when Mrs. Lanagan reminded \n",
      "her that she couldn't want any sugar as she had bought \n",
      "nine pounds during the week, she replied that she wanted \n",
      "a little powdered sugar to put in the beer·-a decoction the \n",
      "essential vileness of which has not prevented its being \n",
      "considered a delicacy even up to the present day. So \n",
      "' Mrs. Lanagan went into the other room and brought \n",
      "back the powdered sugar in a saucer. Then she went back, \n",
      "brought in some beer in a quart measure, and poured out \n",
      "two glasses. While she was doing this, Henrietta walked \n",
      "up and down the room, holding the saucer of sugar in her \n",
      "hand. There was not enough beer in the measure to fill the \n",
      "glasses, and, as Henrietta insisted that they be full to the \n",
      "brim, the good-natured Mrs. Lanagan went back for more. \n",
      "When she returned this time, Henrietta was pouring the \n",
      "sugar into the two tumblers. Mrs. ~anagan filled up the \n",
      "glasses and \n",
      "sat down at the table to drink her beer, appar­\n",
      "ently repenting her initial refusal. But as she lifted her \n",
      "glass she noticed what seemed to be a film of powder on the \n",
      "surface of the beer and took up a spoon to skim it off, \n",
      "thinking that it was the remains of the sugar. Henrietta \n",
      "quickly caught her arm and took the spoon away, saying, \n",
      "''Don't you do so. That is the best of it.\" Just at that \n",
      "moment, Lanagan called to his wife from the store, and she \n",
      "left the room, her beer still untasted on the table. \n",
      "That saved her life. \n",
      "Lanagan, intending to leave his wife to mind the store \n",

      "second, that there were more people than the Lanagans in \n",

      "Lanagans one hundred dollars. She asked Ostrom what \n",
      "she should do. He advised her to go to the chief of police. \n",
      "Whereupon, Henrietta jerked a revolver from her breast \n",
      "and remarked that she was quite capable of defending her­\n",
      "self. Mr. Ostrom, being both \n",
      "cautious and practical, an \n",
      "admirable combination when dealing with a homicidal maniac, took the revolver from her and probed the barrel \n",
      "with the handle of his penholder. The chamber was loaded, \n",
      "and Ostrom observed that there were three or four per­\n",
      "cussion caps on the hammer. He noticed further, however, that the lock was so rusty that it was doubtful whether \n",
      "the gun could be fired. (This revolver was, evidently, one of \n",

      "So far as her identity was concerned, she was now, \n",
      "equally, for the first time, as publicly exposed as though \n",
      "she had been set on a platform in the market place. \n",
      "Surely the concentrated light of publicity now throw11 \n",

      "It didn't. • \n",
      "From the very outset Henrietta's mental disorder dis­\n",
      "played itself in a hundred ways. Her cell was peopled with \n",
      "her enemies: a mob had broken into the jail during the \n",
      "night to attack her; the inmates of the adjoining cells had \n",
      "threatened to put her into a cauldron of boiling water. \n",
      "And in the very midst of her recital of these nightmares \n",
      "she would break off to laugh meaninglessly and to complain \n",
      "that she was shabbily dressed. It was not, could not have \n",
      "been acting. The woman was indisputably insane. \n",
      "Parenthetically, it is interesting that her nameless lover, \n",
      "who had kept her in the white cottage by the river for so \n",
      "long, neither revealed himself nor lifted a hand to help her -n·ow or at any other time. He evidently considered that \n",

      "and the question which of the four Wood girls she was \n",

      "in Great Britain. He visited Henrietta in prison, stayed \n",
      "more than an hour, and then came out, very pale and \n",

      "Robinson was Charlotte Wood. \n",

      "She was found violently ill in her cell one afternoon, \n",

      "the attempt failed. \n",
      "Henrietta was not arraigned for trial until the fall term \n",

      "further postponement on the ground that her mental \n",

      "again in court the following February, 1854. \n",
      "The defense now stated that they were willing to pro­\n",

      "Mr. Hegeman, offered to conduct them to the room of \n",
      "Mrs. Robinson, in compliance with their particular request, \n",
      "as each one of them was very anxious to see her. The door \n",
      "was opened, and the jury with much dignity walked in. \n",
      "They surrounded a large rocking \n",
      "chair in which she sat \n",
      "closely vailed. Some of them very politely requested her \n",
      "to withdraw it. She made no response whatever, but sat \n",
      "perfectly silent and motionless. Their anxiety was so \n",
      "great, that they requested the jailer to remove the vail, \n",
      "which he respectfully declined to do. Finally, one of the \n",
      "jury stepped up and removed it himself, when to their \n",
      "very great surprise, no Mrs. Robinson was there, but on \n",
      "the contrary a silk dress neatly stuffed, after the latest \n",
      "Parisian fashion! The bird had flown,-where? The jailer \n",
      "was asked if she had escaped. Search was instantly made • \n",
      "A slight titter, at length, was heard proceeding from under \n",
      "the bed. The curtain was raised, and there she lay, so full \n",
      "of laughter, that she could hardly contain herself. What \n",
      "increased the joke considerably was the fact that one of the \n",
      "jury, feeling himself punctured in his official dignity, made \n",

      "to her sanity, her legal responsibility for what she had \n",

      "• • adequate motive for murder, but, since they were pleading \n",
      "her as insane, it was surely too much to expect a mad­\n",
      "woman to behave rationally. Witness after witness was \n",

      "and unmistakable evidence of prolonged insanity. \n",
      "On one point, and that one of greater interest to the \n",
      "public than any other, no evidence was offered. Henrietta's identity was not touched upon. So far as the trial was con­\n",

      "From the first time she appeared in court, the prisoner kept \n",
      "her face covered by her heavy veil. The judge first re­\n",
      "quested, then implored, and finally demanded that Henri­etta bare her face so that witnesses might, at least, be able to testify that she was the woman they were talking about. \n",
      "For a long time she held out against the combined efforts \n",

      "Three incidents combined to show that he lied. \n",
      "First, a clergyman who had, some years before, often \n",

      "to see Henrietta, who greeted him with: \n",
      "''I recognize you, sir. I used to hear you preach at the \n",
      "Ferry Street Church, when I was at school at the semi­\n",
      "nary.'' And she went on from there to speak of the '' re­\n",
      "vival'' which had so stirred her in her school days. \n",
      "The clergyman, on his _part, did not recognize her, but \n",
      "there was no reason why he should have been able to single her out from among a hundred other schoolgirls of ten \n",
      "years before. This is certainly evidence, of a kind, that \n",
      "Henrietta had gone to the seminary at the same period as \n",
      "Charlotte Wood, but it is no more than that. The second \n",
      "incident is more convincing. \n",
      "The Wood family had had, in Quebec, an Irish seam­\n",
      "stress who had married and gone to live in Troy. She was \n",
      "there when Charlotte was in the seminary and remembered \n",
      "her well and with great affection. This woman, whose first name was Mary and whose last is not given, also paid a \n",
      "visit to the prison, at Henrietta's \n",

      "No sooner had she \n",

      "'' Charlotte, Charlotte, is it indeed you?'' \n",
      "Mary stayed at \n",
      "th~ prison for a week, \n",
      "nearly all of the \n",
      "time in Henrietta's cell, sleeping and eating with her. \n",
      "She certainly must have known who it was for whom she \n",
      "had so great an affection. \n",
      ". The third incident should \n",
      "have been, and was, except for \n",
      "those who had a special reason for differing, conclusive. There were a number of ladies in Troy who had been \n",
      "schoolmates of the Wood girls. One of these told a friend \n",
      "that if Henrietta Robinson was Charlotte Wood, it would \n",
      "be found that the little finger of her right hand was \n",
      "permanently crooked, as the result of a fall from a horse. \n",
      "Henrietta's hand was examined. The little finger of the \n",
      "right hand was crooked. ' As Emerson said, circumstantial evidence can some­\n",
      "times be very conclusive as when one finds a fish in the \n",
      "milk. The great majority of the students of crime will \n",
      "readily testify that circumstantial evidence is distinctly \n",
      "to be preferred to direct. All evidence is fallible, but \n",

      "or maliciously. \n",
      "Circumstantially, it was assuredly indicated, if not \n",
      "wholly proven, that Henrietta Robinson was Charlotte Wood. As this became increasingly clear, the prisoner was \n",
      "forced from one admission to another, until she was \n",
      "obliged to confess the truth. \n",
      "This did not still gossip, however, or hush the tongues \n",
      "of controversy. The Wood family persistently denied her. \n",

      "do-well of nineteen, son of a poor Bethlehem family, with­\n",
      "out prospects, would have been unsuitable enough as a \n",
      "match for Maria Van Dusen even if his reputation had \n",
      "been a good one and it wasn't a good one. He was an \n",
      "idle, unprincipled young rake, with a distinct weakness \n",
      "for gin, cards, and women. With women, undeniably, \n",
      "John Hendrickson had a way with him, a bad way. \n",
      "The Van· Dusens were the substantial family of Clarks­\n",
      "ville, which was only a short distance from Bethlehem, \n",
      "where the Hendricksons lived. Only recently Lawrence Van Dusen, Maria's \n",
      "(ather, had retired from the \n",
      "clerkship \n",
      "of Albany County, an important and lucrative post, pos­\n",
      "sessed of a comfortable income which was regarded by his \n",
      "neighbors as wealth. There were well filled mows and sleek \n",
      "cattle in the Van Dusen barns, well ordered and substantial \n",
      "comfort in the Van Dusen house. Perhaps the phrase, \n",
      "'' rich and respectable'' describes them. And Maria, seven­\n",
      "teen, pretty and strong willed, was the youngest daughter \n",
      "and the spoiled darling of the family. \n",
      "In contrast to this, the Hendricksons were little better \n",
      "than ''poor whites,'' and John Hendrickson junior was the worst of the litter. \n",
      "i The Van Dusens had protested against the marriage, but • Maria was too used to having her own way to give in, and \n",
      "ultimately they had consented with what grace they \n",
      "could muster. And so, with misgivings in which the entire \n",
      "community enthusiastically joined, the Van Dusens ac­\n",
      "cepted the situation, and in January, 1851, the pair were \n",
      "married and ca111e home to the Van Dusen house to live. The \n",
      "Hendric~sons had no room for \n",
      "them, and at least the \n",
      "arrangement permitted the Van Dusens to keep an eye on \n",
      "things. An older sister and a son of the family were both \n",
      "married, happily and suitably, in neighboring communi­\n",
      "ties, and Maria and her brother Lawrence were the only \n",
      "children living at home. \n",
      "This mixed household, in which Hendrickson was far \n",
      "from popular, was a poor start for any marriage, but in \n",
      "this instance it probably made little difference. The match \n",
      "was doomed from the beginning. \n",
      "Any \n",
      "woman who marries a man to reform him is a fool, \n",
      "and pretty Maria Hendrickson was no exception. She was \n",
      "only seventeen, pretty, spoiled, and stubborn. She was \n",
      "plump, with masses of glossy brown hair, and charming \n",
      "blue eyes; quite attractive enough to have caught the rov­\n",
      "ing fancy of John Hendrickson1-aside from the Van Dusen \n",
      "money·-but not attractive enough to hold it. It is very \n",
      "unlikely that any woman could have held it for long. \n",
      "Maria was lively but not gay, and she was '' good.'' She \n",
      "disapproved of her husband's rowdy companions, disap­\n",
      "proved of his card playing and his drinking, and yet, dis­\n",
      "approving of his habits and his friends, she was infatuated \n",
      "with him and fiercely possessive. Books have been written \n",
      "' ' \n",
      "' to explain women like Maria, just as books have been \n",
      "written to explain the weather, but neither the weather \n",
      "nor the women have been affected. Maria was pious. She \n",
      "nagged. By the end of three months John Hendrickson \n",
      "was tired of her and had resumed his old ways. \n",
      "In the spring of '51, Maria was pregnant. Now that she \n",
      "was going to have a baby, friends of the young pair reas­\n",
      "sured themselves. Boys will be boys, but when they be­\n",
      "come fathers they settle down. Or, at any rate, they do \n",
      "in books. But this wasn't that kind of a book. Maria ex-\n",
      "pected her baby in November. -\n",
      "That summer Clarksville was \n",
      "shocked from its accus­\n",
      "tomed quiet by an attempted assault upon a respectable \n",
      "young woman, who promptly identified John Hendrickson \n",
      "as her assailant. It was an almost unheard-of outrage in the \n",
      "law-abiding little community, and the town was altogether too hot for Hendrickson. So he went off to Corning, about a \n",
      "hundred and fifty miles away, to let the storm blow over. \n",
      "Lawrence Van Dusen was not cordial when he gave his son­\n",
      "in-law the money to get him out of the way of the law. \n",
      "Tra-vel was slow in those \n",
      "days, and distances relatively \n",
      "greater than now, so John broke the journey to Corning \n",
      "with a stop at Warnersville, Schoharie County. At John \n",
      "Townsend's public house his practised eye dwelt approv­\n",
      "ingly on the neat figure of Jane Bailey, twenty, maid-of­\n",
      "all-work. Mr. Hendrickson himself was a fast worker, but \n",
      "Miss Bailey did not succumb at once. It was only upon the \n",
      "second evening of his blandishments, and after a promise \n",
      "of marriage, that her scruples wete overcome. From ''the • edge of the evening until four o'clock in the morning'' \n",
      "they remained in each other's embraces. This seems to \n",
      "have been a digression common enough in the life of the \n",
      "traveler in \n",
      "Schoharie County in those days, judging from \n",
      "the later comments of contemporaries, and Jane herself \n",
      "testified that nothing had '' happened'' until after they \n",
      "became '' engaged.\" So that was all right. Jane wrote Mr. \n",
      "Hendrickson later to remind him of their sacred vows and \n",
      "to notify him of her preparations for their marriage. \n",
      "In all this it must be remembered that this drab and \n",
      "sordid background, against which the final drama of horror \n",
      "was played, is essential to a proper understanding of the \n",
      "plot of the story. Murder does not spring full blown from \n",
      "the mind. It is \n",
      "rooted as deeply as the deadly nightshade \n",
      "in the soil of evil. It is necessary that we see the gathering \n",
      "of the clouds on the horizon in order that we may fully \n",
      "appreciate the dark terror of the storm that is to come. \n",
      "Of the sojourn in Coming nothing is know11, excepting as \n",
      "it may be inferred from subsequent events. \n",
      "In November, Maria's baby was born, and soon after­\n",
      "wards, three months having now elapsed since the Clarks-\n",
      "• \n",
      "ville assault, John Hendrickson came home. For the sake \n",
      "of the Van Dusens, the town was ready enough to let by­\n",
      "gones be bygones, and the charge was not pressed. \n",
      "At the Van Dusen house, Maria sat up in the big \n",
      "mahogany four-poster, her dark hair falling on the white \n",
      "pillowcases with their ruffled edges, and held John \n",
      "Hen--drickson' s baby to \n",
      "her full white breast. The family was in \n",
      "a pleased flutter. John came in, kissed Maria, and picked ' the baby up, awkwardly, with an embarrassed laugh. \n",
      "There were no reproaches. \n",
      "Six weeks later Maria took the baby and paid a visit to \n",
      "John's family in Bethlehem. And there, in circumstances \n",
      "that were never fully explained, the baby died. It was \n",
      "found dead, sleeping with its parents, lying lifeless on the outer edge of the bed, next to its father. Had it been smothered under the clothes? Had John lain on it? No one ever knew. At any rate, John had not wanted the \n",
      "baby, and \n",
      "now the baby was dead. \n",
      "Mrs. Van Dusen com­\n",
      "forted her daughter, and thereafter, when the baby's \n",
      "death was mentioned, she looked narrowly at her son-in-\n",
      "law. \n",
      "That month Maria's ill health became more pronounced. \n",
      "She complained of continual pain, and in January of 1852 \n",
      "she confided symptoms to her mother which set Mrs. \n",
      "Van Dusen's lips in ~ hard line. She sent for Dr. Spring­\n",
      "steed of Albany. \n",
      "With Maria's continued indisposition and Dr. Spring­\n",
      "steed's repeated visits, Lawrence Van Dusen insisted on \n",
      "knowing just what ailed his daughter. Dr. Springsteed \n",
      "told him. John Hendrickson's philanderings had given \n",
      "him a disease with which he had infected Maria. Charged \n",
      "with the fact, John gave one of the most remarkable ex­\n",
      "planations on record. He said that on his recent visit to \n",
      "Corning he had ''fallen down in the train.\" Maria may \n",
      "have been naive, but she was not as naive as all that. \n",
      "There was a very painful scene. \n",
      "The contrasting points of view of John and Maria on • this episode are entirely characteristic. To Hendrickson, it \n",
      "was--as natural, as inevitable, and \n",
      "as unimportant as the \n",
      "headache that follows a drinking bout. To Maria, it \n",
      "brought a sense of sharne, humiliation, and disgust that \n",
      "even \n",
      "outweighed the dire physical effects. \n",
      "Listening to her bitter reproaches, John Hendrickson \n",
      "glowered out of the window, looking with baffied fury at \n",
      "the ample Van Dusen barns and the wide Van Dusen acres \n",
      "that had tempted him into this tiresome marriage.Then \n",
      "he turned, sneered at her distorted, tear-stained face, and walked out of the room. Downstairs he encountered his \n",
      "father-in-law, who ordered him out of the house. \n",
      "With this dismissal, the story of John and Maria \n",
      "Hendrickson might, and should, have ended, had it not been for Maria's insane infatuation, and for the conven­\n",
      "tions of the day which placed the fact of marriage above \n",
      "any of the evils that might result from the fact. \n",
      "After Mr. Van Dusen had ordered him out, John \n",
      "Hendrickson went back to live with his parents at Bethle­hem, and presently was philandering again as gayly as \n",
      "ever. \n",
      "But Maria had no intention of letting her John go. That \n",
      "winter she paid visits to the Hendrickson family, and by \n",
      "the spring of '52 the pair were so far reconciled that John \n",
      "arranged with a relative in Albany to have Maria visit \n",
      "there while she was being treated by Dr. Springsteed. \n",
      "Just at this juncture, a Jetter from Miss Jane Bailey to \n",
      "John, reminding him of their engagement, fell into Maria's \n",
      "hands and threatened their new peace. But somehow John J explained it away. He could explain anything~except \n",
      "murder. \n",
      "For the young Hendricksons, \n",
      "the summer of 1852 in the \n",
      "smiling Hudson Valley was one of repeated quarrels and \n",
      "reconciliations. Maria had pretty well recovered her health, and as the summer advanced John paid occasional visits to the Van Dusen house. There were periods of calm \n",
      "as well as tempest, but the tempests were more frequent \n",
      "and marked the gathering storm. \n",
      "Then, in October, Lawrence Van Dusen died. \n",
      "Any expectations-that John Hendrickson may have had \n",
      "of profiting under the will, if he was foolish enough to have \n",
      "any, were soon dispelled. The Van Dusen property was \n",
      "left, during her lifetime, to Mrs. Van Dusen, a woman of \n",
      "fifty who was in excellent health, with a one-fourth share \n",
      "to Maria on the death of her mother. John Hendrickson \n",
      "was not even mentioned . \n",
      "• \n",
      "Disappointed in his ow11 expectations, Hendrickson \n",
      "swaggered in the role of Maria's husband. He \n",
      "demanded \n",
      "an inventory taken of the property. He began to assert \n",
      "himself. It was after one of his outbursts, during which he \n",
      "had cursed her in a forthright manner, that Maria told \n",
      "him that whatever became of her share of her mother's \n",
      "estate, at least he would never get any of it! \n",
      "One December morning John talked of going in to Al­\n",
      "bany for the day. He was pulling on his heavy blue over­\n",
      "coat in the kitchen, his knitted cap and mittens on a chair \n",
      "by the door, when Mrs. Van Dusen came in. She sat down \n",
      "and picked up her knitting. ''Maria,'' said John, '' shan't I get you some medicine \n",
      "in tow11 ?'' \n",
      "''N J hn '' .d h. ·r o, o , sa1 1s w11e. \n",
      "John put on his cap, pulled on his mittens, and, with \n",
      "one hand on the door latch, turned to his wife, asking \n",
      "• again: \n",
      "'' Maria, shan't I \n",
      "get you some medicine?'' \n",
      "''No,'' replied Maria emphatically. ''You just want to \n",
      "get me some of that poison that you got last summer, that \n",
      "I wouldn't take, and burnt up!'' \n",
      "Mrs. Van Dusen looked up from her work, startled. \n",
      "''P • M • r'' 01son, aria . \n",
      "''Yes, Mother. You never \n",
      "saw it. I burnt it up.\" \n",
      "John Hendrickson made no reply. He walked out of the \n",
      "kitchen door. \n",
      "Much was made of this incident afterwards, though it \n",
      "was admitted that medicine is often spoken of as '' poison'' \n",
      "in the country. \n",
      "Of one thing, this and other incidents of the kind are \n",
      "proof, and that is that Mrs. Van Dusen never missed an \n",
      "opportunity to widen the breach between the pair. Later \n",
      "• \n",
      "events showed very clearly her dislike and distrust of her \n",
      "• son-in-law and how well both feelings were justified. \n",
      "The next month, January of '53, Hendrickson had an \n",
      "even more tangible grudge against Mrs. Van Dusen. He \n",
      "applied to her for the lease of the Clarksville farm for that \n",
      "year, and she refused to let him have it. Instead, she leased -it to a stranger \n",
      "named Long. That month John Hendrick-\n",

      "• • her sister Susannah's husband, in Clarksville. John was in \n",
      "a black mood . \n",
      ". ''The old lady,'' said \n",
      "he, ''has let out the place to Long.\" \n",
      "''I thought,'' replied Hungerford, '' that you were to \n",
      "h • '' ave 1t. \n",
      "''I wanted it,\" answered Hendrickson, ''but she \n",
      "wouldn't let me have it.\" Truculently, he added, ''They \n",
      "won't gain anything by it.\" \n",
      "The remark may have been nothing more than a bit \n",
      "of the swagger to which he was prone, but Hungerford \n",
      "was to remember it later and to endow it, naturally \n",
      "enough in the light of later events, with the ring of a \n",
      "threat. \n",
      "Rehearsing what he felt to be his injuries at the hands of \n",
      "the Van Dusens, John Hendrickson must have felt that, \n",
      "so far from profiting by his marriage, he had gained no \n",
      "more than a stupid young wife who nagged him and who \n",
      "was always in tears. He was tired of her. He had been \n",
      "cheated of his '' rights.\" He wished to be rid of her. \n",
      "Events moved swiftly now to their cala1nitous and fear-\n",
      "ful end. · \n",
      "Towards the middle of \n",
      "the month Maria went to \n",
      "Bethlehem to visit the Hendricksons. January merged into \n",
      "February, and February is a short month. \n",
      "March came in, bringing the inauguration of President \n",
      "Franklin Pierce. There was good sleighing, and the \n",
      "Hendricksons' neighbors went back and forth on their er­\n",

      "• \n",

      "On the second of the month, William Haswell and Jerry \n",

      "swapping news with the proprietor. A customer came in, \n",
      "not noticing the two in the back of the store, and Mr. \n",
      "Springsteed, who knew him, went forward to wait on him. \n",
      "The \n",
      "customer asked for prussic acid. Mr. Springsteed did \n",
      "not have any, but told him where he thought he could get \n",
      "it. The customer was John Hendrickson. \n",
      "Springsteed does not seem to have thought anything \n",
      "about the episode at the time. It did not strike him as unusual. There were no laws against the purchase of poison by anyone who wanted it and could pay for it. \n",
      "Country people were always dosing themselves, and if \n",
      "they wanted to dose with prussic acid, that was their busi­\n",
      "ness. Thirty-eight years later, in Fall River, Lizzie Borden was to try to buy prussic acid and was to be refused. Times \n",
      "had changed. \n",
      "John Hendrickson went, at Mr. Springsteed's sugges­\n",
      "tion, to another pharmacist, Burroughs, at the corner of \n",
      "South Pearl and Plain streets. There, he \n",
      "d-id not ask for \n",
      "prussic acid, \n",
      "but for ''sixpence worth of aconite.\" Mr. \n",
      "Burroughs sold him an ounce vial of tincture of aconite \n",

      "It was mid-afternoon, but the Slingerland family had \n",
      "only just finished th·eir noon dinner and were still at the \n",

      "She had had a long walk in the open air. Perhaps the \n",
      "Hendrickson meal had not been very tempting. \n",
      "So she tossed off her wraps, stood at the table, and ate \n",
      "apple sauce, a piece of sausage, and a slice of johnny cake, \n",
      "and washed it down with two cups of tea. She was in \n",

      "but just about the first of \n",
      "March the young couple moved • to an attic room that had been used by a farm hand, but \n",
      "which was then vacant. This attic room could only be \n",

      "bare and squalid, without floor covering, was lit feebly by an \n",

      "Maria into the little parlor, where she had been reading \n",
      "aloud from the Bible only a few hours before, and placed . \n",
      "her on an improvised bier. \n",

      "Maria's body stretched out stiffly beside him. They tried \n",
      "to \n",

      "a fit, \n",
      "for her nightcap was in place, her hair smooth under it, \n",
      "and the bedclothes undisturbed. And, moreover, old Mrs. Hendrickson had been awake the whole night. She had \n",
      "been in discomfort with her cold and had had to sit up in \n",
      "bed. She \n",
      "knew there had been no sound, for, in that ram-\n",

      "glances. Many-tongued rumor flew. \n",
      "That afternoon they took Maria's dead body home to \n",
      "her mother. Mrs. Van Dusen, after one look at it, knew \n",
      "that her daughter had not died naturally. There was more \n",
      "than mere distrust of her son-in-law in this. There were \n",
      "material facts. Maria's face was curiously swollen and of a \n",
      "strange undeathlike pallor. The flesh was oddly spongy. \n",
      "The lips were blue, and there was a bruise on the outside of \n",
      "the lip that showed as a cut inside. And, although the body \n",
      "showed an unnatural rigidity, even allowing for rigor mor­tis, when the mother lifted one of the arms, it fell back \n",
      "into place with an uncanny elasticity. Country people \n",
      "are used to the sight of death, and this was not the only corpse that Mrs. Van Dusen had seen. But this corpse \n",
      "was different, strangely, horribly different. \n",
      "There was accusation in Mrs. Van Dusen's eyes and on \n",
      "her lips when the coroner arrived. \n",
      "That evening the coroner summoned two other physi­\n",
      "cians to inspect the body. Meantime, the Albany druggist, William Springsteed, hearing of the sudden and mysterious \n",
      "death of Maria Hendrickson, recalled that her husband \n",
      "had been in his shop the week before inquiring for prussic \n",
      "acid. He notified the coroner promptly. The inquest was \n",
      "held that same evening. \n",
      "John Hendrickson, being called, repeated his story of \n",
      "Maria's death, adding that she had complained constantly \n",

      "' her usual health and had eaten regularly. Asked about his \n",

      "last Sunday.\" Interrogated further, he \n",
      "said, as if correcting himself, '' Oh, yes! I believe it was a \n",
      "week ago last Saturday.\" And when the same question was \n",
      "put a third time, he remembered that '' It was last Satur­\n",
      "day.\" He never admitted to the visit, earlier in the week, \n",
      "to which there were many witnesses. He gave, or pur­\n",
      "ported to give, a circumstantial account of the visit that \n",
      "he admitted to the city, but he could not remember hav­\n",
      "ing been in Springsteed & Bullock's store, did not even \n",
      "know the location of any other drug stores, and finally, \n",
      "'' when asked whether he had been in a drug store at all, \n",
      "looked up as if startled at the question, hesitated, and did \n",
      "not remember.\" It was a painfully bad showing. \n",
      "• The coroner found the circumstances sufficient to war­\n",
      "rant a post mortem, and the physicians stayed in the \n",
      "neighborhood so that they might conduct it the next day. \n",
      "Tuesday morning, Stephen Van Dusen, Maria's brother, \n",
      "arrived from Berne, a few miles away. On entering the \n",
      "Van Dusen kitchen, Stephen found John Hendrickson, his \n",
      "head resting on the back of a chair in front of .him, staring \n",
      "down at the floor. Stephen asked whether he \n",
      "could see his \n",
      "sister's body. John assented, dully, and directed him to \n",
      "the f root of the house. When Stephen returned to the \n",
      "kitchen, John had gone. The brother went out to the \n",
      "wood shed, where he found John, his thumbs hooked in \n",
      "the armholes of his vest, his head bent, still staring at the \n",
      "ground. \n",
      "Nothing in the chronicle of John and Maria Hendrick-' . --\n",
      "son is so sinister as the silences that shriek out of it. The \n",
      "silence of the house the night that Maria died. The silence \n",
      "of the family when the Meads were there that fatal \n",
      "morning. And now the silence of Maria's brother. \n",
      "There is no evidence that Stephen Van Dusen did or did \n",
      "not suspect his sister's murder at this time, and it may be \n",
      "that he was simply inarticulate, gauche. It may bP-e -\n",
      "othet wise. Stephen looked \n",
      "idly around the wood shed, and \n",
      "said: \n",
      "'' Mother has poor wood to burn. It ought to be cut up , \n",
      "so it could dry.\" \n",
      "John answered him mechanically. The suspense was tell­\n",
      "ing on him. Surely Stephen had more than that to say! \n",
      "This studied silence about Maria was worse than open \n",
      "accusation. John couldn't stand it any longer. \n",
      "'' Have you seen Maria?'' \n",
      "he asked. \n",
      "''Yes,\" said Stephen. \n",
      "Nothing more. No regret, no reproach, no accusation. \n",
      "If there was anything in Stephen Van Dusen's mind he \n",
      "kept it to himself. At that moment John Hendrickson \n",
      "was as near to funk as he ever came to' be. \n",
      "''What are they doing?'' he said. \n",
      "Stephen told him that the coroner and the other doctors \n",
      "were in consultation. The autopsy was in progress. \n",
      "'' Go in,'' urged Hendrickson, '' and ask if they are will­\n",
      "ing for me to send for Dr. Springsteed.\" \n",
      "Stephen went and came back, faintly nauseated from \n",
      "the sight and smells of the front room, its windows open a \n",
      "crack at top and bottom, the homely earthenware bowl of \n",
      "' dreadful relics sitting among the bric-a-brac on the mantel­\n",
      "piece. John was standing where he had left him, and \n",
      "before Stephen got up to him John called out: \n",
      "'' What are they doing? What do they find?'' \n",
      "''They are taking out the stomach. I don't know that \n",
      "they have found much of anything.\" \n",
      "And then John Hendrickson's conscience spoke through \n",
      "his pallid lips. \n",
      "''One thing I know. They won't find arsenic!'' \n",
      "It was a mild \n",
      "March day, thawing and sunny; and the \n",
      "livestock had been turned out into the barnyard. John \n",
      "pointed out some hens and a cow that had belonged to \n",
      "Maria. There were some sheep lying on the hay, and when \n",
      "Stephen drove them off, John commented that two of \n",
      "them were Maria's, that her father had given them to \n",
      "her. With dreadful fascination the subject of Maria held \n",
      "him. \n",
      "'' She didn't live to enjoy them,\" said Stephen. \n",
      "''No,\" said John, ''she is dead.\" \n",
      "He was obsessed with the desire to talk. He rehearsed \n",
      "the scene of Maria's death as he had told it that morning. \n",
      "They had gone to bed at ten. He had wakened at two. \n",
      "• And so on. Stephen, either from delicacy or distaste, \n",
      "merely replied that \n",
      "'' it was a very sudden death,'' and \n",
      "tried to change the subject. He inquired what share of the \n",
      "farm the tenant, Long, had. Bitterly, John repeated his \n",
      "complaints that he had beep refused the lease of \n",
      "the farm. \n",
      "And, stoically, Maria's brother remarked that perhaps \n",
      "it was just as well, since Maria was dead. \n",
      "• ''Yes,\" said John, ''she is dead. We went to sleep at \n",
      "eleven. I woke at three.\" \n",
      "He repeated his story again, and Stephen noticed that \n",
      "in this recital there was an hour's difference in the time. \n",
      "The autopsy \n",
      "was over. \n",
      "Three practised physicians were satisfied that Maria \n",
      "Hendrickson had been poisoned, and that, from the condi­\n",
      "tion of her stomach and intestines, she had vomited, per­\n",
      "haps for as much as an hour and a half, before she died. \n",
      "She must have died, they said, in fearful convulsive agony. \n",
      "Maria Hendrickson had fought hard for life. It was \n",
      "pre­\n",
      "posterous to believe that the occupants of that little farm­\n",
      "house, much less the husband who lay by her side, had been \n",
      "unaware of her agony. \n",
      "The next day, the sheriff and his deputy came to the \n",
      "Van Dusen house and arrested John Hendrickson for \n",
      "murder. . \n",
      "Sitting beside sheriff and deputy in the house after his \n",
      "arrest, Hendrickson asked: \n",
      "• ' \n",
      "'' Have they found any poison?'' \n",
      "The deputy said that he did not know. \n",
      "'' Suppose,\" Hendrickson continued, '' suppose they had \n",
      "put poison in her stomach yesterday. Could it be found?'' \n",
      "The deputy asked whom he meant by ''they.\" \n",
      "''The doctors,\" Hendrickson said darkly. \n",
      "The deputy retorted that '' they would do no such \n",
      "thing,\" but he remembered the remark. It was Hendrick­\n",
      "son's second slip. \n",
      "• The prosecution was to allude to it afterwards, and to \n",
      "comment: \n",
      "''We have often heard it remarked in regard to the trial \n",
      "of Robinson for the murder of Helen Jewett, that one \n",
      "simple remark which he made to the officer at the time of \n",
      "his arrest, and before the officer had informed him of the \n",
      "offense with which he was charged, was convincing proof \n",
      "of his guilt. That remark was-'Why do you arrest me? \n",
      "I have not committed the murder.''' \n",
      "Robinson's trial took place in New York in 1836. The \n",
      "prosecution might have adduced even more effectively the famous remark of Professor Webster when he was told that \n",
      "Dr. Parkman's body had been found: ''Have they found \n",
      "all the body?'' For it was only three years before, in 1850, \n",
      "that Professor Webster had murdered Parkman and burned his body. Or, had they been endowed with the \n",
      "gift of prophecy, the prosecution might have cited the \n",

      "There was nothing approaching modern police procedure \n",
      "in Albany County, in 1853, and the Hendrickson house \n",
      "was not searched for traces of the stained nightclothes and \n",
      "bed linen which would have established the fact of -Maria's continued and violent nausea to a country jury \n",
      "as medical inference never could. Whatever the suspicions \n",
      "' of the Meads, they were obliged to testify that there were \n",
      "no such traces present when they arrived. Of course, the \n",
      "soiled linen could have been concealed. There were two \n",
      "chests in the attic room, and John Hendrickson had sat on \n",
      "one of them the whole time the Meads were there. But \n",
      "this was mere surmise not proof. \n",
      "Twenty years later, a somewhat similar case of poison­\n",
      "ing, the Bravo case, was detected by the discovery of traces \n",
      "of vomit on a window ledge, where it had been thrown out \n",
      "of the window. In the Hendrickson case, the prosecution \n",
      "contended that this was what had-happened, but nothing \n",
      "seems to have been done to verify the assumption. \n",
      "Nevertheless, direct proof being absent, circumstantial \n",
      "evidence began to be gathered and to be pieced together \n",
      "for the coroner's jury. \n",
      "There was the evidence of William Haswell and Jerry \n",
      "Haight, who had seen the prisoner in Springsteed's drug store in Albany, and the evidence of the proprietor him­\n",

      "before. \n",
      "And there was the evidence of the doctors that Maria's \n",

      "There was the evidence of a bruise on her lip and a cut \n",
      "inside, where some hard object had been pressed against \n",
      "her mouth. The bruise had not been there the day before, and the doctors testified that it could not have been made \n",
      "after death. Was it a little glass vial that had been forced \n",
      "between her teeth ? \n",
      "And there was the \n",
      "evidence of the light upstairs. \n",
      "Wendell Oliver told of passing the Hendrickson house \n",
      "about midnight on that ill-starred Sunday, and of seeing a \n",
      "light in the attic window. It was from an hour and a half \n",

      "which seemed to indicate that some hard object had been \n",
      "pressed against her stub born mouth. Could one person have accomplished this, or had there been an accomplice? \n",

      "said that he usually threw anonymous letters aside, but \n",
      "that as in this case the facts could be proved or disproved \n",
      "so easily, he thought he would investigate it. He further said, 'My hope is that this is not my wife, but some other \n",

      "it is or not.' He was very much excited, so much so that \n",
      "he put his hands to his head, and sobbed in the lobby of \n",
      "the House of Representatives. He rushed from the sofa \n",
      "on which he was sitting, and went into another room, in \n",
      "-a corner. He said, \n",
      "'Get a carriage. We'll go there, and I'll \n",

      "Sometime during the evening, Wooldridge called at the \n",
      "house with his first report. It contained little, but that little was of immense significance. The veiled woman had \n",
      "been to the house on Fifteenth Street the day before, \n",
      "Thursday, in the afternoon. Sickles relaxed, with a great, \n",
      "gasping sigh of relief. It just so happened that he could \n",
      "account for nearly every minute of Teresa's time on Thurs­\n",
      "day. It was not she! Still, to make doubly sure, he in­\n",
      "structed Wooldridge to go back to his rented room, check his report, and, further, to get the most minute descrip­\n",
      "tion possible of the various costumes in which the mys­\n",
      "terious woman had been seen. Wooldridge went, and \n",
      "Sickles returned to the revision and correction of his \n",
      "speech on the Navy bill. A load had been lifted. \n",
      "The next day, Saturday, Sickles spent in the seclusion \n",
      "of his \n",
      "office at the Capitol. He \n",
      "was still on edge and ap­\n",
      "prehensive. He waited for Wooldridge to reassure him \n",
      "positively. \n",
      "At four in the afternoon, Wooldridge came, and ten \n",
      "minutes later Daniel E. Sickles was a broken man. \n",
      "In checking his earlier report, Wooldridge had discov­\n",
      "ered that the visitor to the house on Fifteenth Street had been \n",
      "there on Wednesday, and not \n",
      "on Thursday after-\n",
      "• \n",
      "noon, as he had first reported. And Sickles knew that on \n",
      "• Wednesday afternoon Teresa had been, supposedly, walk­\n",
      "ing on Pennsylvania Avenue with the small Laura. It had \n",
      "been against his wishes, but she had gone. Further, Wooldridge now brought detailed descriptions of several \n",
      "dresses that the veiled woman had worn-the watchful \n",
      "-eyes of the neighbors \n",
      "had lost nothing----and Sickles could \n",
      "not escape the \n",
      "sick realization that every one of those dresses had its exact counterpart in Teresa's big mahog­\n",
      "any wardrobe. There was a favorite black-and-white \n",
      "tartan, a black velvet cloak _trimmed with lace that they \n",
      "had \n",
      "bought together in Paris, a black velvet shawl with \n",
      "a fashionably long fringe, a little beaver hat trimmed \n",
      "with velvet, and others. He knew them all. There could be \n",
      "no further question. \n",
      "It is improbable that Sickles determined on murder at \n",
      "this time. The man's mind was a curious mixture of am­\n",
      "bition, pride, wounded vanity, outraged affection, and \n",
      "sheer hysteria. Which one of these would be uppermost during a crisis would be impossible to predict. Half a dozen possible courses were open to him, and at this \n",
      "juncture it is quite certain that the man had not made \n",
      "his choice. Indeed, from this point on, Sickles' power of \n",
      "choosing for himself or of acting or thinking rationally seems to have completely deserted him. \n",
      "Wooldridge took his leave, and Sickles left the Capitol \n",
      "for Lafayette Square, arriving there just before six \n",
      "o'clock. It was observed by the servants that his manner \n",
      "was strange, and that there was some '' unhappy feeling'' \n",
      "between husband and wife. Mrs. Sickles dined alone. \n",
      "Sickles had food sent to his bedroom. By this time Teresa \n",
      "was undoubtedly alarmed. Her conscience was uneasy. \n",
      "It was all too evident that trouble was brewing and that \n",
      "she was implicated. Unable to stand the suspense, im­mediately after her own meal Teresa Sickles went to their \n",
      "joint bedroom and confronted her husband. \n",
      "Precisely what occurred between husband and wife on that evening of Saturday, February 26th, will never be \n",
      "know11, but from the evidence given at the trial it is pos­\n",
      "sible to reconstruct the scene in part. A contemporary ac­\n",
      "count says: \n",
      "'' At first, she strongly denied her guilt; but when asked \n",
      "by her husband whether on the previous Wednesday \n",
      "[sic.] afternoon she had not entered the house on Fif­\n",
      "teenth Street, in a certain particular dress, she was over­\n",
      "come by her feeling and exclaiming, 'I am betrayed and \n",
      "lost!' swooned away.\" \n",
      "This may or may not be accurate. It is somewhat \n",
      "difficult to know just how the early chronicler became \n",
      "apprised of these intimate details, although, a little later \n",
      "on, there was to be little enough left to the imagination. \n",
      "Some definite facts are, however, known to us. \n",
      "In the first place, the door of the Sickles' bedroom was \n",
      "partly open. This was not chance, as will appear later, \n",
      "but a calculated move on the part of Sickles to forestall \n",
      "any assertion of Teresa's that he had used violence in the \n",
      "process of extracting the confession he intended to have. \n",
      "The man is a most amazing mixture of hysteria and \n",
      "caution. Alternately we find him whimpering with self-\n",
      ". pity and using a sledge hammer to crush a moth. Even his \n",
      "strength is the strength of weakness. \n",
      "Sickles was cool enough to leave the door open. The \n",
      "house was at high tension. The servants listened. At first, \n",
      "the voices coming from the bedroom on the second floor \n",
      "were loud and angry. This-was followed by a period \n",
      "of \n",
      "quiet. Then came a burst of hysterical sobbing in which \n",
      "' ' • both voices joined. Finally, the door was flung wide, \n",
      "and Mr. Sickles called for Bridget Duffy, Mrs. Sickles' \n",
      "maid, and for Miss Ridgeley, the resident governess. The \n",
      "women came. They found Sickles, his eyes red and \n",
      "swollen, standing near a small desk. At the desk sat \n",
      "Mrs. Sickles, her face in her hands, sobbing. As Bridget and \n",
      "Miss Ridgeley came into the room, Teresa Sickles strug­\n",
      "gled to control her tears. As she wiped her eyes, she asked \n",
      "in a broken voice that they sign, as witnesses, a document \n",
      "she had just written. Observe that she made the re­\n",
      "quest, not Sickles. Clearly, Teresa was acting under \n",
      "orders. Sickles was taking no chances of being accused of \n",
      "coercion. And so Mrs. Sickles signed a paper that lay on \n",
      "the desk, and the witnesses signed after her. It was all \n",
      "very regular and legal and contemptible. The two women witnesses noticed that Teresa signed her maiden name \n",
      "-Teresa Bagioli. Evidently she felt, or had been made \n",
      "to feel, that it was \n",
      "all she had a right \n",
      "to now. From this \n",
      "moment on, it is clear that Teresa was crushed hopelessly, \n",
      "finally, and to her death. , \n",
      "The witnesses departed, and \n",
      "the paper did not appear \n",
      "again for some time. It was the now famous confession, \n",
      "one of the most utterly tragic documents that criminal \n",
      "history has preserved. \n",
      "Little more was said or done that night. Sickles went to \n",
      "bed, if not to sleep. Mrs. Sickles spent the night sitting on the floor of Miss Ridgeley' s room, her head resting on \n",
      "a chair. Whether this banishment from the family bed­\n",
      "room was at her own instance or on her husband's de-mand, no one will ever know. It was probably the former. \n",
      "~ Sunday, February 27th, was bright and clear, but on \n",
      "Lafayette Square the sun shone on tragedy. Teresa Sickles \n",
      "did not emerge from her upstairs room at all that day. One \n",
      "cannot but wonder whether the stricken woman antici­\n",
      "pated the terrible events of that fatal Sunday. Probably \n",
      "not. In any case, she sent no word of warning. It is prob­\n",
      "able enough that when her husband left her on the night \n",
      "before, he had expressed no intention other than that of \n",
      "divorce. Even the divorce one is left to deduce from the \n",
      "confession. So that what happened at two o'clock that \n",
      "day must have come to Teresa like a thunderbolt. \n",
      "Sickles went downstairs at about half-past eight. Kindly \n",
      "Bridget Duffy, who met him on \n",
      "the way, says that, '' He \n",
      "held his face in his hands and was crying and sobbing \n",
      "and in great trouble. I commenced crying too.\" One can at least be certain that Bridget's tears were sincere and \n",
      "not a carefully calculated exhibition. Even earlier than \n",
      "this, however, Sickles had felt \n",
      "the need of advice and \n",
      "con­\n",
      "solation and had sent a message, by whom it is not known, \n",
      "to a Mr. Butterworth, an old New York friend, 'to come \n",
      "to him at once. \n",
      "Mr. Butterworth was waiting for Sickles \n",
      "· in the study when he came down, and later in the morning \n",
      "they were joined by the lame clerk, Wooldridge, whose \n",
      "initial attempt at spying had \n",
      "been so successful. Exactly \n",
      "what passed, it is impossible to know, for the lengthy \n",
      "conversation was largely confined to Butterworth and Sickles, who spoke in lowered tones, and neither of whom \n",
      "was ever called to the stand. (That Butterworth, as heavily \n",
      "' \n",
      "• • implicated as he was, was not called as a witness is only \n",
      "one of the astounding points arising in the course \n",
      "of the \n",
      "trial.) Wooldridge did testify, however, and it is from his \n",
      "account that we are able to get some idea of the situation. \n",
      "Faced with the possibilities provoked by various \n",
      "courses of action, Sickles was unable to make up his mind \n",
      "what to do. He wanted counsel. Apparently, at the outset, \n",
      "Butterworth advised prudence, for Wooldridge overheard \n",
      "him say, ''Only ourselves know of this.\" He was wrong, \n",
      "and doubtless knew it. The whole city was well aware of \n",
      "the affair between Key and Teresa-Sickles and had been \n",
      "for months past. The husband was, as usual, the last to know. That Sickles appreciated this \n",
      "is shown by his reply, \n",
      "''The whole town knows of it! What would you do?'' \n",
      "This was certainly Butterworth's opportunity to advocate \n",
      "sanity, but he made the stupid and fatal error of saying, \n",
      "'' As a man \n",
      "of honor, I have no advice to give you.\" If \n",
      "• Butterworth had had a higher sense of honor, and con-siderably more ordinary common sense, a life might have \n",
      "been saved-perhaps two lives. \n",
      "At this point in their conversation something happened \n",
      "that really determined the outcome of the whole affair. \n",
      "The climax came swiftly. \n",
      "Hours had been spent in talk, and it was now nearly \n",
      "• \n",
      "two in the afternoon. Butterworth had delivered his last \n",
      "speech as he and Sickles stood looking out of the window \n",
      "that faced on the Square. \n",
      "As the last words were spoken, Key walked by the \n",
      "house, looked smilingly towards the upper windows, • \n",
      "• and waved his handkerchief with a peculiar flirting gesture. \n",
      "That was enough. \n",
      "Sickles and Butterworth looked at each other, turned \n",
      "and left the room. Wooldridge, happily innocent of trouble, \n",
      "was amusing himself with stereopticon views. It was a \n",
      "quaint pastime, under the circumstances. Though he too \n",
      "was near the window, he did not see anyone leave the \n",
      "house by the front entrance, so that Sickles and Butter­\n",
      "worth must have departed via the kitchen door. \n",
      "Once they were outside the house, Butterworth hur­\n",
      "ried on ahead and, catching up with Key, just about \n",
      "where the Belasco Theater is today, detained him for a \n",
      "minute in talk. This gave Sickles the chance for a direct \n",
      "frontal attack. As Butterworth stepped back, Sickles, \n",
      "white and grim, advanced upon Key with: \n",
      "'' Key, you scoundrel, you have dishonored my home! \n",
      "You must die!'' \n",
      "Key, realizing instantly that his moment was upon \n",
      "him, \n",
      "raised his hand to his breast as if to draw a weapon. Fate \n",
      "was against him. He had gone armed for weeks, doubtless \n",
      "in anticipation of just such an emergency, but today, of \n",
      "• \n",
      "all days, he was unarmed. Sickles drew a revolver from \n",
      "the pocket of his overcoat and fired point-blank. The shot \n",
      "took effect, but not mortally. Key grappled with his \n",
      "adversary. Sickles threw him off, and Key retreated, cry­\n",
      "ing out, '' Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't murder me!'' \n",
      "Sickles said nothing but, advancing to within ten feet of -Key, fired again. Key \n",
      "fell to the gutter. Once more, Sickles \n",
      "fired, the third bullet striking close to the second. Only \n",
      "• • \\ then did the murderer throw his smoking gun to the side­\n",
      "walk and walk coolly away, accompanied by Butterworth. \n",
      "There were several eyewitnesses to the shooting, and \n",
      "Key was at once carried into the Cosmos Club, near by. \n",
      "In fifteen minutes he was dead. That Sunday the judg­ment of man had outrun the judgment of God. \n",
      "It will be observed that, despite his hysterical condi­\n",
      "tion of the early morning, testified to by Duffy, Sickles \n",
      "had been perfectly calm during the killing. Evidently, the opportunity for action brought him some measure of re-lief. This was not to last. \n",
      "-\n",
      "Sickles and Butterworth returned \n",
      "to the Sickles house, \n",
      "and the police were notified. In an hour Washington was \n",
      "agog. Here was a scandal in high life indeed ! The United \n",
      "States District Attorney shot down in cold blood by the Congressman from New York! Captain Goddard, chief \n",
      "of police, came to. the Sickles house, accompanied by \n",
      "Mayor Berrit and others. Before \n",
      "their· advent, however, \n",
      "a strange scene \n",
      "took place which throws an interesting \n",
      "light on Sickles' state of mind, and which was an impor­\n",
      "ta11t factor in the trial that followed. Mr. Robert J. Walker, \n",
      "a Washington man and a friend of Sickles, came to the \n",
      "house as soon as he got word of the shooting. Mr. Walker's \n",
      "account of his interview with Sickles is important. \n",
      "'' It was either three or twenty minutes after three \n",
      "o'clock that I saw him in his own house on the afternoon \n",
      "of that day, in the back room of the first story. As he came \n",
      "in, his manner appeared excited. There was something \n",
      "strange and unusual about it. His voice was somewhat • different from the manner in which I had usually heard \n",
      "him speak. He advanced and took me by the hand. I \n",
      "think he then said, 'A thousand thanks for coming to see \n",
      "me under these circumstances.' He had scarcely repeated \n",
      "these words before I saw a great change in his appearance. \n",
      "He became very much convulsed indeed. He threw him­self on the sofa, covering his face with his hands. He then \n",
      "broke into an agony of unnatural and unearthly sounds \n",
      "-something like a scream, interrupted by violent sob­\n",
      "bing. From his convulsed appearance, he was in the act \n",
      "of writhing. His condition appeared to me to be very \n",
      "frightful, appalling me so much that I thought if it lasted \n",
      "much longer he must become insane. He was indulging \n",
      "in exclamations about dishonor having been brought \n",
      ". to his house, his \n",
      "wife and child. He seemed particularly \n",
      "to dwell on the disgrace brought upon his child. Such an \n",
      "exhibition is sufficiently rare to deserve attention.\" \n",
      "~ Undoubtedly, Sickles was a neurotic. Undoubtedly, too, \n",
      "he saw at this moment his life in ruins about him. His wife \n",
      "was dead for him, his career ended. Rage, injured pride, \n",
      "and an inevitable emotional reaction all combined to \n",
      "make up the outburst. Mr. Walker thought that his cries were grief. They were more than that. They were utter despair, the despair of an essentially weak man who was \n",
      "wallowing in an excess of self-pity, and who was willing to \n",
      "adopt any means, no matter how ignoble, to gain sym­pathy. It has been said \n",
      "t-hat these explosions of Sickles \n",
      "were \n",
      "carefully staged with a view to pleading insanity \n",
      "at tl1e trial, but it is probable that they fell short of that. ' And in the meantip}e, while all this was going on, who was \n",
      "there to comfort the young wife, hidden away in the room \n",
      "upstairs, her lover dead at the hands of her husband? \n",
      "From now on Teresa Sickles becomes a shadow that ldrifts \n",
      "out of the story, and that was soon to drift out of life. \n",
      "Looking back over the years, it seems rather curious \n",
      "that popular sympathy should have flooded in on Sickles, \n",
      "as it did immediately after his arrest, on the Sunday of \n",
      "the murder. Doubtless it was that odd American complex \n",
      "that painted Harry Thaw as a knight in shining armor. \n",
      "For every American who would '' rather be right than \n",
      "President'' \n",
      "there seem to be ten who would rather be \n",
      "maudlin. At any rate, Sickles became the hero of the hour. \n",
      "The trial was set for April 4th, and in the month that \n",
      "intervened little else was talked of in Washington. For \n",
      "the moment, even the burning question of slavery took \n",
      "second place. Sickles' cell was knee deep in flowers. Not­\n",
      "ables flocked to see him and to congratulate him---od \n",

      ". \n",
      ". Mrs. Sickles had vanished. \n",
      "On an evening not long \n",
      "after the shooting, a heavily veiled figure slipped out of \n",
      "the house on Lafayette Square and into a closed carriage. Teresa Bagioli was going back to her father's house in \n",
      "New York. Even the consolation of her child was denied \n",
      "her. Laura remained in Washington, safe from the con­\n",
      "taminating influence of her mother. \n",
      "The day of the trial arrived. It was to last for eighteen \n",
      "days. Sickles was represented by a large body of brilliant \n",
      "counsel. The state did not fare so well. The plea was Not \n",
      ",, • \n",
      "• ---- ------- -\n",
      "Guilty, and the defense that Sickles was of unsound mind \n",
      "at the time of the shooting. In making this point, however, \n",
      "the defense found it expedient to paint Mrs. Sickles in \n",
      "the darkest colors, so that, to the spectators, it was rather \n",
      "a trial of Mrs. Sickles for adultery than of Daniel E. \n",
      "Sickles for murder. Just thirty years later, in England, Mrs. Maybrick was engulfed by a like whirlpool of moral indignation. At the Washington trial, Mrs. Sickles was \n",

      "shooting of Key raised him to a peak of popularity that \n",
      "no one, not even himself, could possibly have predicted. \n",
      "It was as if every American husband, in deadly fear of \n",
      "being made a cuckold, resolved to cite Sickles as the \n",
      "shining example of what would happen if-- Even his \n",
      "desertion of Teresa was acclaimed. Her pitiable confession became public even before it was admitted as evidence \n",
      "-it was in the hands of the defense and was read by \n",

      "had done its \n",
      "best to keep the pathetic document out of \n",

      "was finally read to the jury, each side blamed the other \n",
      "for its lack of good taste. This confession, which was \n",
      "supposed to have driven Sickles insane, but which had \n",
      "obviously been dictated by him, was as follows: \n",
      "-\n",
      "''I have been in \n",

      "did what is usual for a wicked woman to do. The intimacy \n",
      "commenced this winter when I came from New York, in that house an intimacy of an improper kind. Have \n",
      "met half a dozen times or more, at different hours of the \n",

      "Would arrange meetings when we met in the street, and \n",
      "at parties. Never would speak to him when Mr. Sickles \n",
      "was at home; because I knew he did not like me to speak \n",
      "to him; did not see Mr. Key for some days after I got here. \n",

      "that the clerk at this desk was young Daniel Frohman, \n",
      "who is described in a contemporary account as being \n",
      "'' a decidedly good-looking young gentleman of eighteen \n",

      "There was only the crash of the shot and the sudden \n",

      "It is at this point, at the very moment of arrest, that \n",
      "accounts begin to differ and, indeed, not only to differ, \n",
      "but to become completely opposed. As we shall see, there \n",
      "were excellent reasons for covering McFarland. \n",

      "Daniel McFarland was the \n",
      "son of an Irish immigrant \n",
      "who had come to this country in 1823 and had settled in \n",
      "New York. At fourteen Daniel was apprenticed to a tailor, \n",
      "but making clothes for other men had few charms for a \n",
      "boy~ who wanted to be \n",
      "well dressed himself, and the next ~-few years were roving ones of which the account is frag-\n",
      "mentary. Daniel McFarland went South for a time; came \n",
      "back and went into business with his brother, who was a \n",
      ",harness maker in Newark; and, somewhere around 1840, \n",
      "gravitated to Boston, where his occupation was unknown. \n",
      "He must have had some ambition at this time, and he \n",
      "must have saved his money, for in 1848, when Daniel was \n",
      "twenty-eight years old, he entered Dartmouth College. I I 7 \n",
      "At Dartmouth, McFarland seems to have specialized \n",
      "i.n chemistry, and during his third year he was made a sort \n",
      "of infor1r1al assistant to the professor heading that de­\n",
      "partment. But McFarland was restless-he was always \n",
      "restless---and his third college year \n",
      "was his last. At the \n",
      "suggestion of the professor of chemistry, he went to \n",
      "Europe to study, stayed there a year, came back and \n",
      "studied for the law! He was admitted to the bar in Massa­chusetts but never practised. Then came another year \n",
      "as professor of logic and elocution- od knows how the \n",
      "two were coupled or even reconciled \n",
      "!'-in Brandywine \n",
      "College down in Delaware; \n",
      "and at just about this time \n",
      "McFarland's further interest in any regular occupation \n",
      "seems to have ceased. \n",
      "The man was a dreamer, but without the courage or \n",
      "statnina to carry out his dreams. He was born for failure \n",
      "because he hadn't the backbone for anything else. And \n",
      "when a man like that fails, he turns to crime. \n",
      "During 1852, when McFarland was meandering through \n",
      "New England for no very special reason, he ran across a \n",
      "poor family of weavers who were living in Lowell, Massa­\n",
      "chusetts. Only one of the family interested McFarland, \n",
      "• however, and that was \n",
      "Abby, the daughter, who was then \n",
      "about fourteen, an exceedingly pretty girl and one who \n",
      "gave the impression of having undiscovered potentialities. \n",
      "McFarland left Lowell, but he did not forget Abby Sage. \n",
      "Five years later, in 1857, he_went back and married her. \n",
      "They were married, this oddly assorted pair, on De­\n",
      "cember 4, 1857, when Abby was nineteen and McFarland \n",
      "' • \n",
      "' • lUU \n",
      "thirty-seven. Quite aside from any other drawback, the \n",
      "difference in years was too great. And there were other \n",
      "drawbacks, profound ones. \n",
      "In the five years that had intervened between the meet­\n",
      "ing and the marriage, the little daughter of the weaver \n",
      "had grown in more than height. She had become the \n",
      "teacher of a little country school in Manchester, New \n",
      "Hampshire; and she had begun to write little pieces for the papers, pleasant, harmless little pieces about children \n",
      "and nature and what-not. Abby Sage was on the way to \n",
      "becoming an author. But McFarland told her that he had \n",
      "a fine law business in Madison, Wisconsin,-to which he \n",
      "had gravitated-with twenty or thirty thousand dollars \n",
      "in real money, and Abby was impressed. Not that she \n",
      "married him for that. There is every reason to believe \n",
      "that she really loved her Daniel, and doubtless she was \n",
      "touched by the fidelity of a man who had waited for her \n",
      "for five years. She was to learn, however, that whatever McFarland had been during those years he had certainly not been faithful, and she was to learn--other things. \n",
      "She had not long to wait after the wedding. \n",
      "On their bridal journey, in New York, on their way to \n",
      "Madison, they stopped long enough to permit McFarland \n",
      "to borrow the remainder of their train fare. When they \n",
      "finally arrived at Madison, Abby discove1·ed that the law \n",
      "practise, along with the twenty to thirty thousand dollars, \n",
      "was as mythical as buried treasure. \n",
      "By February of '58, two months after their marriage, \n",
      "they were back in New York again. McFarland promptly \n",
      "• • and efficiently pawned the few small articles of value that \n",
      "Abby had, and then sent her home to her father to wait \n",
      "for better times. They never came. \n",
      "The entire married life of the McF arlands is summarized \n",
      "by the first two months of their marriage. There was this \n",
      "difference, however: as Daniel went \n",
      "down, Abby went \n",
      "up. She refused to sink with him. \n",
      "McFarland seems to have taken up drinking as a \n",
      "profession at about the time they moved to a cottage in \n",
      "Brooklyn, in the autumn of 1858. Before that he was no \n",

      "''That he was imprudent, that his sympathy carried \n",
      "him into ways which a nicer prudence and a larger worldly wisdom would have eschewed is hardly to be doubted. \n",
      "But that he consciously violated any law of God, or any \n",
      "canon of morality which human society has thrown \n",
      "around the household, his most familiar friends utterly \n",
      "deny.\" \n",
      "And again: \n",
      "''I believed that she [Abby] \n",
      "was both legally and \n",
      "morally justified in separation from a brutal husband, who, to excessive and outrageous personal abuse, had also \n",
      "furnished that one extreme ground of divorce which \n",
      "justifies it in the eyes of all Christendom.\" \n",
      "And finally: \n",
      "''I vowed that they [def~nders of the Union, of \n",
      "whom \n",
      "Richardson was one, during the recent Civil War] should \n",
      "be my brothers, and that as long as I lived, come what \n",
      "' I ---\n",
      "might, if they carried themselves faithfully towards my \n",
      "native land, then they should never lack a friend in me.\" \n",
      "The first quotation says, in effect, that Richardson did \n",
      "not commit adultery. The second, that McFarland did. \n",
      "The third is a mere gesture. \n",
      "Public opinion twisted these statements promptly, vv-ith \n",
      "this result. \n",
      "Richardson and Abby \n",
      "were guilty of adultery. Therefore, \n",
      "they were adulterers, and Beecher was a defender of adul­\n",
      "tery. Second, nothing had been said about adultery when \n",
      "Abby got her divorce, and, therefore, in charging McFar­\n",
      "land with adultery, Beecher was a liar and McFarland a \n",
      "martyr. Third, in his rhetorical promise to defenders of \n",
      "the Union, Beecher promised to defend all adulterers. \n",
      "This may not seem quite sane. It was not sane! It was \n",
      "mad, and it foreshadowed very accurately what followed, \n",
      "The only new point that Beecher raised was McF ar­\n",
      "land' s infidelity. Abby had been quite frank in accusing \n",
      "him of it to her friends, though she had refused to divorce \n",
      "him on those grounds. Mrs. Calhoun had reported this \n",
      "to Beecher. Whether he was actually guilty or not, no \n",
      "one knows, though probably he was. \n",
      "This was on December 3rd. The inquest had taken place \n",
      "the day before at the Coroner's Office in City Hall. The \n",
      "proceedings were brief and formal. Proof of the shooting \n",
      "and of Richardson's death was given, and the jury returned \n",
      "a verdict against McFarland, who was remanded for trial. \n",
      "There were two points, however, that stand out as worthy \n",
      "of attention. McFarland was represented by counsel, ---\n",
      "the leader of which was the then famous John Graham, \n",
      "one of the best known trial lawyers in the city. \\Vhere \n",
      "did the money come from for this defense'? By whom was McFarland being financed? A contemporary account of \n",
      "the inquest says that: \n",
      "''Many politicians crowded into the room, and most of \n",
      "them wore diamond cluster pins of large size and great \n",
      "value. The Coroner had one of these. So did one or two of his friends who conversed with him confidentially. \n",
      "While the testimony was being taken, some one of the \n",
      "politicians was imitating the crowing of a rooster in the \n",
      "hallway. This caused a momentary smile to overspread the countenances of the spectators and others. ost imme­\n",
      "diately afttrwards, it seemed as though the ceiling was \n",
      "coming duw11 in consequence of a crowd of politicians \n",
      "rushing rudely out of a room overhead.\" • \n",
      "The juxtaposition of ideas in McFarland's mysterious \n",
      "defense fund and a gleeful crowd of politicians, is ines­\n",
      "capable. Boss Tweed was in his heyday of power, and \n",
      "Tammany saw that McFarland was going to be useful. \n",
      "He was useful, very useful indeed. \n",
      "Two newspaper editorials, published at this time, show \n",
      "• which way the wind was blowing. The New York \n",
      "Sun, \n",

      "very entertaining, if only because it is \n",
      "just about as typical a picture of Horace Greeley on the \n",
      "warpath as one could get. At the same time, however, that \n",
      "shrewd old fighter put his finger unerringly on the crux of \n",
      "the whole affair. The real issue was already lost sight of in \n",
      "the chance to attack the Tribune. There were other factors \n",
      "involved. \n",
      "Adultery had sidetracked murder in the public mind, as \n",
      "it usually does in Anglo-Saxon communities which con­\n",
      "sider adultery much the more heinous crime of the two \n",
      "because it is so much more enjoyable. The point of view of \n",
      "the public on adultery is, generally, ''I want to commit \n",

      "here unless it was McFarland's.-for there was not and \n",
      "never has been one jot or tittle of evidence indicating an \n",
      "improper relationship between Abby and Richardson. The \n",
      "• thing was ·manufactured. There were three curious reasons \n",
      "why this was done. • \n",
      "First, there was the \n",
      "newspaper war, which was being \n",
      "fought with almost incredible violence in that day of \n",
      "bitter editorial enmities. Horace Greeley and his Tribune \n",
      "were on one side, and everybody else was on the other. \n",
      "Not that that bothered Greeley in the slightest, for a news­\n",
      "paper was nothing but a weapon to him, and a weapon \n",
      "that he well knew how to use. Dana had taken over the \n",
      "Sun in 1868, having quit Greeley in 1861, after fourteen \n",
      "years on the Tribune, and his parting from his old chief \n",
      "was not cordial. Bennett, of the Herald, had been at bitter \n",
      "odds with Greeley since before the Civil War, chiefly \n",
      "because Bennett felt that avoiding the war was more \n",
      "important than freeing the slaves, while Greeley was a \n",
      "red-hot Abolitionist. The World, the only other paper of \n",
      "real consequence, was just coming into power and was \n",
      "more than willing to be a thorn in anybody's side. And \n",
      "Greeley was a violent man. He did not have opinions: he \n",
      "had passions. Either you were for him or you were against \n",
      "him, and if you were against him it was up to you to look \n",
      "out for your own skin. That type of man can exist only \n",
      "• so long as he is able to defend himself. Once his guard is \n",
      "dow11---the pack is on him. \n",
      "These papers and their editors, \n",
      "along with the smaller fry, saw in the Richardson-McFar­land \n",
      "affair the chance to push \n",
      "Greeley in a comer'-to make \n",
      "him appear to be \n",
      "the defender of immorality, of free \n",
      "love and what-not. They cared nothing for the facts \n",
      "they \n",
      "were distorting out of any reasonable shape and nothing \n",
      "' for the justice they were perverting, or, if they cared about \n",
      "these matters at all, they cared about them far less than \n",
      "they did about the chance to knife Greeley and the \n",
      "Tribune. Use the tar brush. Blacken. Besmirch. No \n",
      "matter, so that Greeley was hit. \n",
      "Second, there was the situation with Tammany. Boss \n",
      "Tweed was in his full flush of power; New York politics \n",
      "were as rotten as Ta111many \n",
      "was able to make them, and \n",
      "every decent paper in the city was up in arms. (They put \n",
      "down their arms long enough to attack the Tribune, how­\n",
      "ever. They didn't hate Tammany less, but Greeley more.) McFarland was a Romanist, which counted with \n",
      "Tam­\n",
      "many. He was a ward-heeler. And, most of all, he had shot. \n",
      "a friend of Greeley's; his wife had divorced him for love of \n",
      "a Tribune correspondent. His enemies were friends of the \n",
      "Tribune. To defend him was to attack the Tribune and \n",
      "Greeley, Tammany's most feared and hated foe. The \n",
      "choice was not difficult. \n",
      "McFarland thus had on his side Tarnmany, who \n",
      "would have defended him anyway, if it had bothered \n",
      "with him at all, which is very doubtful; and the entire \n",
      "press of New York, who were willing to forego their fight \n",
      "with Tammany to hit the Tribune. But the third factor \n",
      "was the most important of all. That was public opinion. \n",
      "The United States was, at this time, in the throes of \n",
      "one of those ''moral blizzards'' which now and again make \n",
      "havoc of its sanity. Whole libraries of.,books have been \n",
      "written to explain these phenomena, but most of the \n",
      "explanations differ unaccountably. It is a peculiarity \n",
      "• • of this country alone, and is probably what we mean \n",
      "when we refer to our '' national institutions.'' The visible \n",
      "symbol of this outbreak was three words-Free Love and \n",
      "F ourierism. \n",
      "Free love is always with us, more or less. We keep it in \n",
      "mothballs and drag it out when we lack other excitement. \n",
      "We had it not long ago when the alleged Soviet theory of \n",
      "the '' communization of women'' filled us with hope and \n",
      "alarm. An agitator and a soap box, with free love as the \n",
      "theme for the bedtime story, will always draw a crowd. In \n",
      "this instance, it remained only for Mr. Fourier to cast the \n",

      "before witnesses. Other points are much more unusual: \n",
      "the length of time that elapsed between the alleged crime \n",
      "and the discovery of the body of the victim; the difficulty \n",
      "of identifying the remains; the practical impossibility of \n",
      "proving beyond reasonable doubt that the victim died \n",
      "by violence. All these could be developed from a possibility \n",
      "into a probability, but to carry this progression into the \n",
      "final step of a certainty could not, by any legal means, \n",
      "be accomplished. The case has been compared with that \n",
      "of the murder of Dr. Parkman by Professor Webster, but \n",
      "in that instance the remains were found within one week, \n",
      "and identity was established, in part, by means of the \n",
      "teeth. In the Lowell case, however, the skeleton of the \n",
      "deceased was not found until more than three years after \n",
      "the supposed crime, and not only was identification \n",
      "through the teeth impossible, but the entire skull was \n",
      "missing, thus throwing a certain doubt on the exact man­\n",
      "ner of death. In short, the entire case bristled with an \n",
      "array of those difficulties that are the delight of lawyers \n",
      "and the despair of laymen. _ \n",
      "From the very outset, \n",
      "naturally enough, the bone of \n",
      "contention was the identity of the skeleton. The medical \n",
      "evidence showed that the bones were those of a woman of Lizzie Lowell's approximate age and height, and that \n",
      "they had been lying exposed on the ground for about the \n",
      "length of time that \n",
      "Lizzje had been missing. And \n",
      "that \n",
      "was about all there was to that. On the other hand, the \n",
      "experts, so called, did bring out one fact of considerable significance: The bones of the neck, where the head had \n",
      "been joined to the body, were not scarred, as they must \n",
      "have been had the head been hacked off by an unskilled \n",
      "hand. This fact could be interpreted variously. If the head had not been removed violently from the corpse, it must \n",
      "then have been removed after decomposition had reached \n",
      "the point at which the skull could be detached from the \n",
      "vertebr~ without scarring. Had this \n",
      "been done by the \n",
      "murderer, returning after a long lapse of time to conceal \n",
      "the one portion of the body that bore traces of his work? \n",
      "If this was so, the killer certainly-took a very long chance \n",
      "in waiting as long as he must have \n",
      "done. Either that, or \n",
      "he was extraordinarily absent-minded in not thinking of \n",
      "this obvious precaution sooner. A dare-devil or a fool­which? \n",
      "Also---if it was the murderer \n",
      "who took away the \n",
      "skull, why did he not also take \n",
      "the betraying clothes? \n",
      "Indeed, why did he not bury the whole ghastly business \n",
      "and have done with it? Having asked these and \n",
      "other \n",
      "pointed questions, the defense suggested that the missing \n",
      "head had been stolen by some prowling animal, a fox, \n",
      "perhaps, which would readily explain the whole affair. \n",
      "The defense may have been quite right. The whole truth \n",
      "as to the missing head is not know11 to this day, although something that happened after the trial did throw rather \n",
      "more light on the question. \n",
      "The skeleton having told its story, the clothes, shoes, \n",
      "buttons, and small ornaments that had been found on or \n",
      "near it were called on for testimony. The ground here was \n",
      "more firm. Women in Lizzie Lowell's station in life, living \n",
      "• • in a provincial town, do not usually have an extensive \n",
      "wardrobe; and what there is of it is, usually, of local manu­\n",
      "facture. The testimony in this connection would be interesting only to a specialist in women's dress at a period \n",
      "when it was almost as ugly as men's clothes are today. \n",
      "There was much talk of '' a black silk sacque, trimmed \n",
      "around the bottom with lace and a piece of fringe,\" laced \n",
      "boots, made of serge with cloth tips, a skirt that was fitted \n",
      "to the waist by being plaited in front and gathered behind, of the relative merits of silk and cotton thread in dress­\n",
      "making, of gores, machine and hand sewing, and a thou­\n",
      "sand and one technical details which, however greatly they may have interested the ladies present, must have \n",
      "sorely bored and puzzled the jury. In any event, the state \n",
      "was able to prove, at least beyond all reasonable doubt, \n",
      "that the garments that clothed the skeleton were the same \n",
      "as those that had clothed Lizzie Lowell the last time she \n",
      "had been seen. \n",
      "And then the letters, the ones from Jim to Mrs. Burton, \n",
      "and still more those that purported to come from Lizzie \n",
      "herself after her disappearance. Nearly all of them have \n",
      "been given here, and the reader, except for the facts of \n",
      "handwriting, can be his own judge. At the outset it was \n",
      "very clear that whoever wrote the letters was illiterate to the point of unintelligibility. It was difficult even to \n",
      "find the same errors made twice in the same way. In the \n",
      "-end, however, it became clear that the prisoner had written \n",
      "them all, and the net, \n",
      "which had been steadily drawing \n",
      "closer, \n",
      "now was almost tight. • At last the state closed its case, having done an ex­\n",
      "ceedingly able job, and sat back to see what the defense \n",
      "could make of it. It couldn't make much. It simply didn't \n",
      "have the materials. Not that Lowell's attorneys didn't \n",
      "fight hard and well, because they did, but they lacked the concrete \n",
      "stuff of which successful murder \n",
      "defenses \n",
      "are made. They denied that the skeleton was that of \n",
      "Lizzie Lowell, and they unwisely attempted to prove \n",
      "their denial. They denied that the clothes and other \n",
      "adjuncts belonged to her, but the evidence was straight \n",
      "against them. If the corpse was not Lizzie's, certainly \n",
      "Lizzie's husband \n",
      "could not be tried for her murder. Then \n",
      "where was Lizzie? Just where Jim Lowell had always said \n",
      "she was-,departed with a '' circus fell er'' for parts un-\n",
      "known. \n",
      "Suddenly, on the seventh day of the trial, the defense \n",
      "sprang a surprise _witness in support of this amazing con­\n",
      "tention. Whether Lizzie had or had not run off with the \n",
      "circus on the Sunday morning after the last performance, \n",
      "there was at least one person in town who had; and who \n",
      "had now come back to tell all about it. This was young Wilmot Nelson, aged twenty at the time of the trial and, \n",
      "hence, about seventeen when he was chore-boy at the \n",
      "DeWitt House in Lewiston on that eventful night in 1870. \n",
      "Wilmot deposed that on \n",
      "the night the circus closed, \n",
      "Satur­\n",
      "day night, he. ~had seen Lizzie Lowell in \n",
      "a room on the \n",
      "second or third floor of the DeWitt House in company \n",
      "with another woman and two men, all circus people, and \n",
      "that he, Wilmot, had supplied them with liquor (Maine \n",
      "• • being dry at the time). After setting this compromising \n",
      "scene, Wilmot further testified that he had slept with one \n",
      "of the circus men who had offered him a job, and that in \n",
      "accord with this agreement he had left with the circus \n",
      "the next morning, continuing in its employ until it had \n",
      "broken up in Providence. Now the circus, as so often \n",
      "happens when a road show makes a jump over a week-end, had left Lewiston in two sections: the first on Sunday, \n",
      "and the second early on Monday morning. Wilmot's ver­sion was that he traveled with the second group, and that \n",
      "he saw Lizzie Lowell standing on a car platform as he himself got on the train. If this was true, Lizzie certainly was not murdered on Sunday night, for she appears to \n",
      "have left \n",
      "witl-1 the circus Monday morning. Not content \n",
      "with this, Wilmot went on to say that during the course \n",
      "of his occupation as candy butcher with the circus he saw \n",
      "Lizzie Lowell again, this time in the ladies' dressing room \n",
      "at Hyde Park. All these facts, and a few others of less \n",
      "significance, he had communicated to Constable Wiggin \n",
      "at Lawrence not long before the trial. Here was a staggerer! \n",
      "But was it? If there was the slightest chance that Wilmot \n",
      "Nelson was mistaken in his identification of Lizzie Lowell, \n",
      "his entire testimony fell to the ground. Supporting evi­\n",
      "dence was impossible to obtain. The Great Australian \n",
      "Circus of three years before had broken up and was scat­\n",
      "tered to the winds. Wilmot Nelson had made a statement \n",
      "on oath of the greatest p~ssible importance, and it was \n",
      "a \n",
      "statement that he himself clearly believed. But there was \n",
      "no conceivable way by which it could be corroborated. \n",
      "' All that could be done was to send it to the jury and let \n",
      "them make what they could of it. They did. They threw \n",
      "it out. Wilmot must have been mistaken. \n",
      "And so the trial of Jim Lowell for the murder of his wife \n",
      "Lizzie dragged its length through ten February days. It \n",
      "was fair, so far as any such trial in any such community \n",
      "could be, but the defense was clearly handicapped by the \n",
      "fact that most of the community believed Lowell guilty \n",
      "and had from the very outset. \n",
      "On Wednesday, February 18th, it was generally ex--pected that the case would go to the jury by the following \n",
      "day. That evening, when Lowell returned to the jail, he \n",
      "was jubilant. It is not too much to say that he frisked. \n",
      "'' I shall be a free man tomorrow!'' said he. '' The \n",
      "attorney general can't say anything against me.\" \n",
      "He didn't know his man. When the attorney general \n",
      "began his speech on Thursday morning one could see the \n",
      "confidence running out of the prisoner as water from a \n",
      "sprung bucket. During the charge of the judge, Lowell \n",
      "listened quietly, almost as if he were stunned. At six \n",
      "thirty-five that afternoon, the jury retired, and Lowell \n",
      "was taken back to the jail, where he ate little. \n",
      "Meanwhile, in Lewiston and Auburn, little was dis­\n",
      "cussed except the outcome of the trial. The street corners \n",
      "of New England towns do not off er many attractions on \n",
      "a \n",
      "bitter February evening, but one imagines them filled \n",
      "with little knots of townspeople on this particular occasion: \n",
      "great-coated men slapping their arms vigorously and \n",
      "stamping their feet to warm them as they argued as to • whether or not '' that wuthless Jim Lowell did in Lizzie.'' \n",
      "And then, one may be sure, someone would sing out, '' But \n",
      "the head! What did he do with the head?'' Above all other \n",
      "points, however, that were discussed that blustery night, \n",
      "as the jury bickered snugly in their comfortable quarters \n",
      "in the Court House, was the ever-famous one of the letter, \n",
      "Mrs. Burton's letter, the letter of prophecy of three years \n",
      "before, to disbelieve in which would be almost as great \n",
      "a blasphemy as to try to throw discredit on the miracle \n",
      "of Jonah and the whale. \n",
      "At a little after ten the word went round that the jury \n",
      "was ready with its verdict, and at twenty minutes past \n",
      "the hour Jim Lowell stood at the bar. The jury was polled \n",
      "and announced its verdict: MURDER IN THE FIRST DE­\n",
      "GREE. \n",
      "Lowell was taken back to the jail and, according to his \n",
      "own account, slept well that night (a very usual phenom­\n",
      "enom for a convicted murderer on the first night after the \n",
      "verdict). The next day, ''I fell asleep in half an hour after \n",
      "I came back to jail,'' said he. \n",
      "''Was the verdict a surprise to you?'' questioned the \n",
      "• \n",
      "jailer. \n",
      "''Yes,\" answered Lowell gloomily, ''I didn't expect it.\" \n",
      "That noon his wife, with whom he had been living in \n",
      "Lawrence, came to see him, and after a long interview she \n",
      "left in tears. \n",
      "It was on this day too, the 20th, that the court granted a \n",
      "delay of sentence in order to permit the defense \n",
      "to draw \n",
      "up a bill of exceptions. Not until the 6th of May, 1874, .. • \n",
      "' • • ---\n",
      "surely a long wait, was the convicted man brought before \n",
      "the court for formal sentence. His attorneys had with­\n",
      "drawn their exceptions. And then Jim Lowell was sen-\n",
      "tenced to be hanged. \n",
      "But the Maine law at that time \n",
      "was peculiar. \n",
      "In pronouncing sentence, Judge Walton said in part: \n",
      "'' ' ... that you, James M. Lowell, be removed from this \n",
      "place to the State Prison at Thomaston, in the County of \n",
      "Knox; that within the walls, or enclosed yard, of said \n",
      "prison, at such time after the expiration of one year from \n",
      "this day, as the supreme executive authority of this State, \n",
      "by a warrant under the great seal thereof, shall direct, you \n",
      "be hung by the neck till you are dead; and that you be kept \n",
      "in confinement in said prison till this sentence of death \n",
      "shall be inflicted upon you.\"' \n",
      "This curious delay of a year between sentence and \n",
      "execution was provided for by a Maine statute which \n",
      "necessitated a review by the governor and council, not \n",
      "only of the evidence in such cases, but of the complete \n",
      "record. After this review had been made the governor \n",
      "could order the sentence carried out or could direct its \n",
      "commutation. Clearly, this wise provision foreshadowed the day, not far distant, when Maine would abolish \n",
      "capital punishment altogether, and in Lowell's case it was \n",
      "altogether justified. At the expiration of the given period, \n",
      "the governor commuted the sentence, and Jim Lowell was \n",
      "committed to jail for life. \n",
      "That this action was justified became clear when Jim \n",

      "while his statement cannot be proven true, at least it \n",

      "instead of trying to cover his tracks by a network of stupid \n",
      "lies, it is probable enough that he would never have been \n",
      "indicted for a worse offense than manslaughter. For Jim \n",
      "said that he and Lizzie had quarreled that Sunday evening \n",
      "as they drove together up by Switzerland Road, and that \n",
      "in the course of the quarrel he had pushed Lizzie out of the \n",
      "wagon, and that Lizzie, in falling, had broken her neck. It \n",
      "was very probably true. For one thing it accounted for the \n",
      "fact that the missing head had, apparently, not been cut \n",
      "from the body but, the vertebrre being already dislocated, \n",
      "had rolled \n",
      "away of its own accord, leaving no telltale \n",
      "scars. And then-Jim Lowell was a man who would be \n",
      "more likely to threaten than to kill. \n",
      "Sometime during the decade that marks the r92o's, \n",
      "Jim Lowell was released from prison, after having served \n",
      "more than forty years. After that he is to be seen no more. \n",

      "dying of hunger and fatigue in the dark and narrow streets \n",
      "of Bamberg, a city of old Bavaria, he forged the first link \n",
      "in a chain that, nineteen years later, was to deprive one \n",
      "man of his liberty and another of his life. \n",
      "Young Kurt, he was only fifteen at the time, took Neu­\n",
      "mann to his father's estate on the outskirts of the city, \n",
      "fed and clothed him, and had him appointed one of Count \n",
      "Kuno's foresters. Neumann's life was saved and, more \n",
      "than that, from a vagrant he became a man of substance. \n",
      "Neumann was passionately grateful and dedicated his \n",
      "future life to the service of his benefactor. The result of \n",
      "his gratitude is one of the most remarkable stories in the \n",
      "history of crime. \n",

      "• • Trouble was brewing in the ancient house of Von \n",
      "Hohenstaufen. The medireval castle that reared its \n",
      "battle­\n",
      "ments high above the quaint shops and houses of Bamberg \n",
      "was well able to repel the invader, as it had done often \n",
      "enough in times long past, but it could not keep out trouble \n",
      "from within. Two years before, in 1855, Count Kuno had \n",
      "married for the second time and, as so often happens, his \n",
      "only son Kurt had bitterly resented an act which put \n",
      "another in the place he considered should be held sacred \n",
      "to the memory of his mother. Whether there was any \n",
      "material cause for this resentment is not known and does \n",
      "not now matter. The breach widened, until in 1858, the \n",
      "year after our story opens, Kurt, now sixteen, determined \n",
      "to seek his fortune elsewhere. And elsewhere, in his case, \n",
      "as in so many others, meant only America. \n",
      "Count Kuno, who was evidently a kindly man and an \n",
      "affectionate father, did his \n",
      "best to dissuade the boy, but \n",
      "having failed to do so, prepared to take the matter philo­\n",
      "sophically. He was insistent only on one point. Some time \n",
      "before this, Kurt had struck up an acquaintance with one \n",
      "Diedrich Neumann-not to be confused with Thomas, the \n",
      "forester, with whom he had no connection-and this \n",
      "acquaintance had ripened until Diedrich and Kurt were \n",
      "the closest of friends. As a matter of fact, they were about \n",
      "the same age and even looked not unlike each other. These \n",
      "were the only two points of similarity between them, . \n",
      "however, for while Kurt was open and generous, Diedrich \n",
      "was, \n",
      "or seemed to the Count, both sly and sinister. Kurt \n",

      "adventure,\"a step of which his father violently disapproved. \n",
      "Diedrich was bad enough on the spot, in his opinion, but \n",
      "as his son's only friend in a strange country he was out \n",
      "of the question. Still, there was nothing he could charge \n",
      "directly against Neumann. It was only his manner that \n",
      "made the Count uneasy; that and certain minor character­\n",
      "istics that seemed to indicate the possibility of something \n",
      "malign under his somewhat too sleek exterior. But·-Kurt \n",
      "might be right after all. The Count capitulated, perhaps \n",

      "blessed \n",
      "his son, gave him means of identification and of \n",

      "Before the two young men started on their journey, \n",
      "however, something happened that was to have a far­\n",
      "reaching effect. Thomas, the forester, devoted to his young \n",
      "master, requested· that he be taken along as Kurt's per­\n",
      "sonal servant. He too disliked and distrusted Diedrich \n",
      "Neumann. Kurt laughed at him. They would have no need \n",
      "for a personal servant in America, and Thomas had best \n",
      "stay at home. Whereupon Thomas said nothing but went \n",
      "to Count Kuno. \n",
      "The Count and the forester, who was then a man of \n",
      "about thirty, put their heads together quite frankly. They \n",
      "agreed that to let a sixteen-year-old boy, the heir to large \n",
      "estates, go off to America with a companion in whom, to \n",
      "say the least, they felt no especial confidence, was out of \n",
      "the question. Thomas suggested that he follow the pair \n",

      "introduction from the Count, made his way direct to the \n",
      "master of the ship on which Kurt and Diedrich were to \n",
      "sail. The shipmaster readily agreed that Thomas should \n",
      "pay half fare and should be given the position of assistant \n",
      "steward, his duties being to serve the meals to the five hundred steerage passengers who were on board. This kept \n",

      "of the Rev. Elijah P. Lovejoy, who held unpopular views \n",
      "on the question of slavery and who insisted on expressing \n",

      "not seen it, for he made no mention of it, and Diedrich \n",
      "proceeded to act. Luring Kurt to Alton was the first step. \n",
      "There can be few more remarkable sequences of events \n",
      "in the history of crime. Eighteen years before both Count \n",
      "Kuno and Thomas had distrusted Diedrich and had feared \n",
      "his relationship with Kurt. And yet, during the whole \n",
      "course of that eighteen years there seems to have been \n",
      "nothing actually to justify that suspicion. Diedrich makes no move, and does not, so far as is known, even contem­\n",
      "plate crime. \n",
      "Thomas forgets. The watchdog is \n",
      "asleep. And \n",
      "yet, at the end of this period, as if a clock had struck, \n",
      "with no preliminary move to indicate his intention, Died­\n",
      "rich justifies the original \n",
      "suspicion,-and lifts his hand. \n",
      "Arriving in Alton, Kurt promptly went to bed, leaving \n",
      "to Diedrich the task of registering and making all arrange­\n",

      "condition was improved, and he told Diedrich that he \n",
      "thought \n",
      "a few days' rest would put him on his feet again. \n",
      "Mentally resolving otherwise, Diedrich congratulated his \n",
      "friend, and a conversation ensued that marked the next \n",
      "step in the intrigue. \n",
      "'' Do you ever hear from your family now?'' asked \n",
      "Diedrich. \n",
      "''No,\" anwered Kurt, and explained why . \n",

      "the next cautious query. \n",

      "minister in Washington.\" \n",
      "Diedrich's eyes shone. He was right. Kurt had not seen \n",

      "'' But,\" he continued, '' \n",
      "supposing that your father does \n",

      "your property, Can you prove your \n",
      "identity and all that \n",
      "sort of thing?'' \n",
      "''Oh, yes,'' answered the victim. ''There in my trunk \n",

      "red portfolio, lying on top of \n",
      "my letters. Here's the key of the trunk.\" \n",
      "Diedrich opened the trunk, found the red portfolio, and \n",
      "went carefully over the papers inside it. Then he said, \n",
      "''They look all right to me, \n",
      "but if I were in your place I'd \n",
      "have them looked over by a German lawyer in this coun­\n",
      "try, so that if anything in them has to he altered, it can be \n",
      "done before it's too late. Suppose I take them up to St. \n",

      "coming back in the evening. I could easily drop in at a \n",
      "German lawyer's office and make a sure thing of it.\" \n",
      "Kurt agreed. He was too ill to care. \n",

      "• • When Neumann returned from St. Louis, he found Kurt \n",
      "much worse, and nothing was said about the red portfolio. \n",
      "Kurt wanted a doctor, but Diedrich persuaded him to \n",
      "wait until the next day in the hope that he might be \n",
      "better. , \n",
      "The next day, however, Kurt's illness had increased. \n",
      "His head ached fearfully, and several times he lapsed into \n",
      "a partial coma. A doctor now became imperative. Diedrich \n",
      "had been out reconnoitering the evening before, and had \n",
      "located a man who seemed to fit his distinctly peculiar \n",
      "needs. The physician was naturally stupid and, in addition, \n",
      "was a drunkard. He was sent for at once. \n",
      "The doctor came and was taken to the room by a hotel \n",
      "waiter, whom Diedrich requested to remain during the \n",
      "examination, probably giving the excuse that it would be \n",
      "easier for the man to stay and show the -doctor out rather \n",
      "than to come all the way back after him. What Neumann \n",
      "really wanted, however, was an unbiased witness, and the \n",
      "waiter served admirably. The ·examination was superficial, \n",
      "naturally, and the diagnosis was an advanced stage of \n",
      "cerebral congestion-which means just about whatever \n",
      "one wants it to mean. The doctor said that he feared for \n",
      "the worst, but that he would do all that was possible • \n",
      "Accordingly, he wrote a prescription which, when used \n",
      "later in the day, seemed to bring relief. Nevertheless, Kurt \n",
      "grew rapidly worse, though he seemed to suffer less. Three \n",
      "days later he was dead. -There seemed to be \n",
      "nothing out of the way. The doctor \n",
      "gave a certificate stating that the patient had died of acute • congestion of the brain, and no one had any reason to sus­\n",
      "pect that he was wrong. Count Kurt von Hohenstaufen \n",
      "was buried forthwith under the name of Diedrich Neu-\n",
      "mann. \n",
      "Immediately after the funeral, which for some reason \n",
      "took place in Alton, the real Neumann shaved off his chin \n",
      "beard, leaving a pair of flowing whiskers to frame his face. \n",
      "He now looked not at all unlike the man he had just buried. \n",
      "Next, he went back to St. Louis, taking the Count~s \n",
      "baggage with him, and \n",
      "presented himself at the mercantile \n",
      "house where Kurt had been employed. Here, he appeared \n",
      "in his actual person, as Diedrich Neumann. He explained \n",
      "to Kurt's employers that the Count had died suddenly, \n",
      "and that he had come to settle his friend's affairs, as he \n",
      "himself intended to leave at once for Germany to take the \n",
      "sad news to the family and deliver into their hands what­\n",
      "ever was left by the deceased. The firm willingly paid him the amount due to Kurt and expressed their deep regret \n",
      "at the loss of a trusted employee. In coming to the firm in \n",
      "his own name, Diedrich had made a bad move and one \n",
      "that he was to have reason to regret. \n",
      "While all this had been going on, Fate had been setting \n",
      "other machinery in motion. Shortly after the departure of the two friends for Alton, Thomas, in his turn, had seen \n",
      "the personal in the \n",
      "Herald. He at once sent a letter to Kurt, \n",
      "to which he received no reply, although he had every \n",
      "reason to expect a prompt one. Thomas resolved to take \n",
      "his message by hand. He got a day's leave of absence and \n",
      "went up the river to Alton. • ------------ --------\n",
      "When Thomas got to the hotel and heard that Neumann \n",
      "was dead and buried and that the Count had left, he \n",
      "scented trouble. If the Count had left, the chances were \n",
      "that he had returned to St. Louis and Thomas had not seen \n",
      "him there. Further, when the two men left the city, it was \n",
      "the Count who was ill and not Neumann. Suspicion of \n",
      "Neumann and protection of the Count, though they might \n",
      "be dormant for a very long time, really assumed the pro-­\n",
      "portions of a career \n",
      "with Thomas. They were automatic. \n",
      "He made discreet inquiries, got descriptions of the man \n",
      "who was buried and the man who had buried him, and \n",
      "satisfied himself of the truth of the affair. \n",
      "The forester, now an ex-porter, left Alton for St. Louis -\n",
      "and went at once to Kurt's firm. Here he discovered that \n",
      "Neumann had been before him with news of the Count's \n",
      "death and of his own departure. He also heard that Neu­\n",
      "mann had shaved his beard. The man's heart sank. He was \n",
      "forty-eight, and for eighteen years he had borne a self­\n",
      "imposed trust to watch over the man who had saved his \n",
      "life so long ago. And now\"--he had failed. It had \n",
      "all come \n",
      "to nothing. The Count was dead, and by th_e hand of the \n",
      "man whom he, Thomas, had always suspected. Thomas \n",
      "promised himself that if Kurt was dead he would be re-\n",
      "venged. \n",
      "Drawing his savings from the bank and hurriedly pack-\n",
      "ing his few belongings, Thomas left for New York. He \n",
      "knew that Neumann would sail from there. Once arrived, -\n",
      "he looked over the \n",
      "passenger lists of all the outgoing \n",
      "steamers, and finally, after a long search, found the name \n",
      ", Von Hohenstaufen, signed in a strange hand. The steamer \n",
      "was to leave for Germany in two days. Thomas went to a \n",
      "sailors' boarding house, got himself a nautical outfit, and \n",
      "managed to have himself shipped on the same boat that \n",
      "Neumann was taking. The ex-porter was to have his passage in exchange for his work. He had small fear that \n",
      "Neumann would know him, for the bogus Count had never \n",
      "once set eyes on him since leaving Germany, nearly twenty \n",
      "years before. Early in the game it had become a fixed \n",
      "habit with him to conceal himself from Neumann, and \n",
      "Kurt had never broken his promise of silence. If Neumann \n",
      "had changed in all these years, Thomas had changed like­\n",
      "wise. So Thomas joined the ship, and in two days they \n",
      "sailed, with Neumann on board. Had he known that \n",
      "Nemesis walked the same deck with him, Neumann might \n",
      "have been less easy. \n",
      "For the most part, the voyage was uneventful. One \n",
      "thing did happen, however, that was of vital consequence \n",
      "in all that was to follow. \n",
      "On the way over, Thomas scraped up an acquaintance, \n",
      "which soon grew into a friendship, with a young woman \n",
      "named Alice Vogel, who was returning to her native city \n",
      "after having been in America as governess. That city was \n",
      "Bamberg, Thomas's home town, as it was that of Kurt and \n",
      "Diedrich, and this naturally brought the two closer to­\n",
      "gether. One day, \n",
      "irt a fit of depression, \n",
      "Thomas took Alice \n",
      "Vogel to one side and told her the whole story of what had \n",
      "happened in Alton and St. Louis, with all that led up to it. \n",
      "He swore her to secrecy and said that after he had un-\n",
      "• • masked Neumann he intended to retire on his savings and \n",
      "live out his life quietly at home. Alice fully sympathized \n",
      "with him and promised to give what help she could. It was \n",
      "more than either of them suspected at the time. \n",
      "On May 15, 1877, the boat docked at Hamburg, and \n",
      "the passengers went ashore, Thomas and Alice Vogel \n",

      "Kurt in America, and of the reappearance of the Count in \n",
      "Bamberg. I told her that I was only sorry she had not \n",

      "''Not in the least,\" I replied with a bow. ''I am simply \n",

      "One thing will show. I remember that one day, when he \n",

      "broke his arm. The bone was well set, but a ring formed \n",
      "where the fracture had healed. He showed me this several times, for I took a great interest in knowing whether or \n",
